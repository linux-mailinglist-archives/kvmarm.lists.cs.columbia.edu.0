OK, in fact I have considered some of these things before. You are right, DBM dirty logging
is not suitable for guest with high dirty rate which even causes Qemu throttling. It only
reduce side-effect of migration on guest with low dirty rate.

I am not meaning to push this defective patch now, instead I am trying to find a software
approach to solve hardware drawback. However, currently we do not have a perfect approach.

For that ARM SMMU HTTU do not have PML like feature, so the behavior of dirty log sync will
be very similar with which of the MMU DBM. My original idea is that we can support MMU DBM
firstly and then support SMMU HTTU based on MMU DBM.

Sure, we can leave this patch here and hope we can pick it up at future if hardware is ready :-) .
Many thanks for your review ;-) .

Thanks,
Keqian
