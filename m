We change the EOImode solely based on how we were booted (EL2 or not).
KVM doesn't directly influences that (it comes in the picture much
later).

I can only agree. !VHE is something we're going to support for the 
foreseeable
future (which is roughly equivalent to "forever"), and modules have 
properties
that are fundamentally incompatible with the way KVM works with !VHE.

If the only purpose of this work is to be able to swap KVM 
implementations
in a development environment, then it really isn't worth the effort.
