I thought these two bits are newly added in the specification, which is
not available yet... until I've reached patch 29 and 30.

So they are actually some "kvm-implemented" bits and can only be used by
the KVM guests. I have two questions now:

1) As per the latest GIC specification, these two bits are Reserved
    (RAZ/WI) from host's perspective, which is good for now. But will
    they be (unexpectedly) used one day by the future architecture?

2) Only Linux guest will check and make use of these bits now. What if
    some non-Linux guests wants to run with KVM and use the GICv4.1 based
    vSGIs?  Their developers might have no interests reading at the KVM
    code... so what about plumbing some descriptions about these bits
    into somewhere in the documentation (or code)?  Like below, mostly
    copied from your commit messages:

// Roughly writing, for the ease of reviewing the later patches.

No-Active-State SGIs (?) Related Field Descriptions
	--From Guest's Perspective

With GICv4.1, KVM exposes two single bit (in GICD_TYPER2 and GICD_CTLR
respectively) for guests, which can be used to probe the GICv4.1 based
SGIs support on hypervisor and choose whether guests want the good old
SGIs with an active state, or the new, HW-based ones that do not have
one.

GICD_TYPER2.nASSGIcap, bit [8]

     Indicates whether guests are running under control of a hypervisor
     that implements GICv4.1 SGIs, allow the hypervisor to use them at
     the expense of loosing the Active state.

     0b0    GICv4.1 SGIs capability is not offered by hypervisor.

     0b1    GICv4.1 SGIs capability is offered by hypervisor.

     This field is RO.


GICD_CTLR.nASSGIreq, bit [8]

     Indicates whether guests wants to use HW-based SGIs without Active
     state if the GICv4.1 SGI capability is offered by hypervisor.
     Hypervisor will then try to satisfy the request and switch between
     HW/SW delivered SGIs.

     0b0    If read, indicated that guest is using the old SW-emulated
            SGIs.
            If write, indicates that guest requests to use the old
            SW-emulated SGIs.

     0b1    If read, indicates that guest is using the new HW-based SGIs.
            If write, indicates that guest requests to use the new
            HW-based SGIs. If GICD_TYPER2.nASSGIcap is 0, the write has
            no effect.

     Changing this bit is UNPREDICTABLE if the Distributor is enabled.
     KVM may just treat this bit as RO when Distributor stays enabled.


See gic_dist_init() in drivers/irqchip/irq-gic-v3.c for an example that
how Linux guest (since 5.6?) makes use of these bits and benefits from
the GICv4.1 based vSGIs.

These two bits are Reserved (RAZ/WI) from host's perspective, which is
good for now.

Thanks,

Zenghui
