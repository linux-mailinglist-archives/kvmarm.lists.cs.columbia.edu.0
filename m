So we for example check:

	writeable = !(memslot->falgs & KVM_MEM_READONLY);
	if (writeable && !(vma->vm_flags & VM_WRITE))
		return -EPERM;

And yes, user space can then unmap the VMAs and MMU notifiers will
unmap the stage 2 entries, but user space can then create a new
read-only VMA covering the area of the memslot and the fault-handling
path will have to deal with this same check later.  Only, the fault
handling path, via gfn_to_pfn_prot(), returns an address based on an
entirely different set of mechanics, than our prepare_memory_region,
which I think indicates we are doing something wrong somewhere, and we
should have a common path for faulting things in, for I/O, both if we do
this up-front or if we do this at fault time.

What does VM_PFNMAP mean on x86?  I didn't think we were relying on
anything architecture specific in their meaning in the arm code, and I
thought the VM_PFNMAP was a generic mm flag with generic mm meaning,
but I could be wrong here?

Is there any valid semantics for creating a memslot backed by a
VM_PFNMAP on x86, and if so, what are those?

Similarly, if you do map a device region straight to the guest on x86,
how is that handled?  (A pointer to the right place in the myriad of EPT
and shadow code in x86 would be much appreciated.)


Thanks!
