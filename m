There's no reason to wait until get-vcpu-events time to reset this.
According to the KVM documentation (and the code) the event is
immediately delivered at vcpu_ioctl(KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS) time.
So I think the kvm_put_vcpu_events() patch should be

 if (env->ext_dabt_pending) {
     events.exception.ext_dabt_pending = env->ext_dabt_pending;
     env->ext_dabt_pending = 0;
 }

(env->ext_dabt_pending will only be non-zero if we have the capability)

But that's not the way you're using it here. It you really want to
ensure the return value is converted to a bool, then you could do

 ins_fetched = !!cpu_memory_rw_debug()

If KVM can be fixed (and in this case already is fixed - 21aecdbd7f3a),
then doesn't it make more sense to just fix KVM, than to add a workaround
to QEMU?

I think a mechanism for a preferred behavior would be nice, because
all options make sense, depending on the use case. I'm not sure what
the right default is, though. Maybe this dabt injection, but there's
a good chance it'll just loop here. So maybe QEMU should just abort.
Aborting should be the safest default (from the host's PoV).
