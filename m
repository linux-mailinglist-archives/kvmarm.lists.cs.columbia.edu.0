OK, I get it. So FFR is only present if FA64 is supported.

I guess the simplest is to just disable streaming mode on syscall. The C
library would mark the syscall wrappers as not streaming compatible, so
whoever is calling them might disable SM anyway.

So I think your original proposal in the ABI doc is fine (I just need
the libc people to confirm ;)).
