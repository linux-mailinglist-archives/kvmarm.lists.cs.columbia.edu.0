Personally I'd go with something much shorter, e.g. ARM_PTP_PHY_COUNTER. 
This is just an argument to an SMCCC call so there's no need for most of 
the prefix, indeed if (for whatever reason) there was a non-SMCCC 
mechanism added to do the same thing it would be reasonable to reuse the 
same values.

The problem with the 'default' is it means it's not possible to probe 
whether the kernel supports any more clocks. If we used a different 
value (that the kernel doesn't support) then we end up in the default 
case and have no idea whether the clock value is the one we requested or 
not.

It's generally better when defining an ABI to explicitly return an error 
for unknown parameters, that way a future user of the ABI can discover 
whether the call did what was expected or not.

I'm happy either way - it's purely that the definition/naming of 
ARM_SMCCC_VENDOR_HYP_KVM_PTP_PHY_FUNC_ID made it look like that was the 
intention. My preference would be to stick with the 'feature' approach 
as above because there's no need to "use up" the top-level SMCCC calls 
(but equally there's a large space so we'd have to work very hard to run 
out... ;) )

Thanks, I think it's a good idea to get the ABI nailed down before 
worrying too much about the code, and it's easier to discuss based on 
documentation rather than code.

Thanks,

Steve
