I had a look at the series that rejects unsupported VCPU features from a protected
VM [1], and it got me thinking. With this ABI in mind, it will be permitted for an
userspace VMM to do the following:

1. Create a VM -> success.

2. Check the KVM_CAP_ARM_PMU_V3 (cap chosen randomly) on the **VM fd** -> it's
available.

3. Set the VCPU feature and create the VCPU -> success.

4. <do other initialization stuff>

5. Turn the VM into a protected VM -> failure, because KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3 was
part of the VCPU features.

To me, that looks a bit strange. On the other hand, if KVM knew right from VM
creation time that the VM is protected, KVM could have told userspace that that
VCPU feature is not supported **for this particular type of VM**. I think that
makes for a much cleaner userspace API. Yes, it would still be possible to check
the cap on the KVM fd and get success, but we could make the argument that those
capabilities represent the capabilities that KVM supports for any type of VM, not
this particular type.

This can also be used for discovering new features added to pKVM. How do you
intend to do that with the current ABI? By adding a version field to struct
kvm_protected_vm_info, where each version comes with a fixed set of features that
are supported?
