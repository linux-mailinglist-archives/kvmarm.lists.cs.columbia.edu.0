If the check is a simple pfn_valid() I think it should be ok, but yes, we'd
definitely not want to do anything more involved given that this could run
in all sorts of horrible contexts.

That's true, it would offer much weaker guarantees to the guest. It's more
like a guarantee that memory never traps to the VMM. It also then wouldn't
help with the write-combine fun. It would be simpler though, but with less
functionality.

I don't think this would be possible given your comments above.

So let's stick with the approach you've taken. It just feels like there
should be a way to do this without introducing new hooks into the core
code. If it wasn't for pci_remap_iospace(), we could simply hook our
definition of __ioremap_caller(). Another avenue to explore would be
looking at the IO resource instead; I see x86 already uses
IORES_MAP_ENCRYPTED and IORES_MAP_SYSTEM_RAM to drive pgprot...
