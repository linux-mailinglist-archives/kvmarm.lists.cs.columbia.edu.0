Mismatch between the translation stages is an interesting problem...

Given that userspace is responsible for setting up the IPA space, I
can't really think of a strong use case for 52 bit IPAs with a 48 bit
VA. Sure, the VMM could construct a sparse IPA space or remap the same
HVA at multiple IPAs to artificially saturate the address space, but
neither seems terribly compelling.

Nonetheless, AFAICT we already allow this sort of mismatch on LPA &&
!LVA systems. A 48 bit userspace could construct a 52 bit IPA space for
its guest.

Marc, is there any real reason for this or is it just a byproduct of how
LPA support was added to KVM?

Wow, what a matrix!

In a later revision of this series it might be good to add support for
LPA2 guests in KVM selftests. We currently constrain the IPA size to
48bits on !64K kernels.

I'll have a deeper look at this series in the coming days.
