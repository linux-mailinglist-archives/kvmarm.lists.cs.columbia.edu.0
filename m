True, my bad.

I have no idea, but that's beyond this patch.

 I don't know, but probably another version of the if (!!foo)
 construct.  It could definitely be written differently, but it's easy
 enough to understand.

Interesting point.  Re-reading the general definition of the
KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS api, I actually think the cleanest thing here is to
allow setting both at the same time.  I can't come up with a valid case
where the VMM would validly need to do that, but there'd be no harm in
doing it as far as I can tell.

I'll rework this so that checking
ext_dabt_pending is orthogonal for the serror stuff.

With the change proposed above, I believe this concern goes away, as the
two fields are decoupled.
