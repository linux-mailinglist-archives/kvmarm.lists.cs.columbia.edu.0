Yes, if the IORT describes the SMMU incorrectly, things will not work 
well. Just like if it describes the wrong base address or the wrong 
interrupt numbers, things will also not work well. The point is that 
incorrect firmware can be updated in the field fairly easily; incorrect 
hardware can not.

Say the SMMU designer hard-codes the ID register field to 0x2 because 
the SMMU itself is capable of HTTU, and they assume it's always going to 
be wired up coherently, but then a customer integrates it to a 
non-coherent interconnect. Firmware needs to override that value to 
prevent an OS thinking that the claimed HTTU capability is ever going to 
work.

Or say the SMMU *is* integrated correctly, but due to an erratum 
discovered later in the interconnect or SMMU itself, it turns out DBM 
doesn't always work reliably, but AF is still OK. Firmware needs to 
downgrade the indicated level of support from that which was intended to 
that which works reliably.

Or say someone forgets to set an integration tieoff so their SMMU 
reports 0x0 even though it and the interconnect *can* happily support 
HTTU. In that case, firmware may want to upgrade the value to *allow* an 
OS to use HTTU despite the ID register being wrong.

> As the IORT spec doesn't give an explicit explanation for HTTU override, can we comprehend it as a mask for HTTU related hardware register?
> So the logic becomes: smmu->feature = HTTU override & IDR0_HTTU;

No, it literally states that the OS must use the value of the firmware 
field *instead* of the value from the hardware field.

Indeed these features aren't decorative grooves on a piece of furniture, 
but in the case of io-pgtable we're merely using "quirk" in its broadest 
sense to imply something that differs from the baseline default 
behaviour - ARM_MTK_EXT, ARM_TTBR1 and ARM_OUTER_WBWA (or whatever it's 
called this week) are all just indicating extra hardware features 
entirely comparable to HTTU; NON_STRICT is describing a similarly 
intentional and desired software behaviour. In fact only ARM_NS 
represents something that could be considered a "workaround".
