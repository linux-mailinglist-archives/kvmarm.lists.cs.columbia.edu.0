Nod.

I was thinking about a new flag that implies "copy metadata"; not sure
how we would get the same atomicity with a separate ioctl. I've only
just started looking at userfaultfd, though, and I might be on a wrong
track... One thing I'd like to avoid is having something that is too
ARM-specific, I think there are other architecture features that might
have similar issues.

Maybe someone more familiar with uffd and/or postcopy can chime in?
