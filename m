Understood. Thanks for the explanation! Will switch to an inline function.

But is it safe to read kvm->vm_started without grabbing the lock in
the first place? use atomic_t maybe for this?

I've been going back and forth on this. I've seen a couple of
variables declared in the generic struct and used only in the arch
code. vcpu->valid_wakeup for instance, which is used only by s390
arch. Maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way as to what can and can't
go in the generic kvm code.

Thanks,
