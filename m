Hi Steve,

I have finished verifying the POC on a FVP setup, and the MTE test case can
be migrated from one VM to another successfully. Since the test case is very
simple which just maps one page with MTE enabled and does some memory
access, so I can't say it's OK for other cases.

BTW, I noticed that you have sent out patch set v6 which mentions that mapping
all the guest memory with PROT_MTE was not feasible. So what's the plan for the
next step? Will new KVM APIs which can facilitate the tag store and recover be
available?

Regards,
Haibo
