Right, and that was the reason for the PROT_NONE approach in the
previous version, but we agreed it'd be worth generalizing to allow for
future use-cases :-)

Right, though that is also used for the hyp s1 which doesn't use any of
this ATM. That shouldn't be too bad to change, I'll have a look.

And I could even special-case set_owner(0) by calling unmap under the
hood so the caller doesn't need to care, but it's a bit yuck.

Agreed, (1) is a bit nicer. I was also considering setting phys = BIT(63)
in the set_owner() path. That makes it obvious it is an invalid PA, and
it should retain the nice alignment properties I need. But I suppose an
explicit flag makes it easier to reason about, so I'll have a go at it.

Thanks,
Quentin
