The allocation tag (in-memory tag) is a property assigned to a physical
address range and it can be safely shared between different processes as
long as they access it via pointers with the same allocation tag (bits
59:56). The kernel enables such tagged shared memory for user processes
(anonymous, tmpfs, shmem).

What we don't have in the architecture is a memory type which allows
access to tags but no tag checking. To access the data when the tags
aren't known, the tag checking would have to be disabled via either a
prctl() or by setting the PSTATE.TCO bit.

The kernel accesses the user memory via the linear map using a match-all
tag 0xf, so no TCO bit toggling. For user, however, we disabled such
match-all tag and it cannot be enabled at run-time (at least not easily,
it's cached in the TLB). However, we already have two modes to disable
tag checking which Qemu could use when migrating data+tags.
