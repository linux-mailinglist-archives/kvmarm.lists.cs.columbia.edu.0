Arm's prepare_memory_region() holds mmap_sem and mmu_lock while processing
the VMAs and populating the stage 2 page tables.  Holding mmap_sem prevents
the VMAs from being invalidated while the stage 2 tables are populated,
e.g. prevents racing with the mmu notifier.  The VMAs could be modified
after prepare_memory_region(), but the mmu notifier will ensure they are
unmapped from stage2 prior the the host change taking effect.  So I think
you're safe (famous last words).

As Ard mentioned, it looks like an optimization.  The "passthrough"
part from the changelog implies that VM_PFNMAP memory regions are exclusive
to the guest.  Mapping the entire thing would be a nice boot optimization
as it would save taking page faults on every page of the MMIO region.

As for how this is different from other archs... at least on x86, VM_PFNMAP
isn't guaranteed to be passthrough or even MMIO, e.g. prefaulting the
pages may actually trigger allocation, and remapping the addresses could be
flat out wrong.

    arm/arm64: KVM: map MMIO regions at creation time

    There is really no point in faulting in memory regions page by page
    if they are not backed by demand paged system RAM but by a linear
    passthrough mapping of a host MMIO region. So instead, detect such
    regions at setup time and install the mappings for the backing all
    at once.
