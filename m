As far as I can see, to map all the guest memory with PROT_MTE in VMM
is a little weird, and lots of APIs have to be changed to include this flag.
IMHO, it would be better if the KVM can provide new APIs to load/store the
guest memory tag which may make it easier to enable the Qemu migration
support.
