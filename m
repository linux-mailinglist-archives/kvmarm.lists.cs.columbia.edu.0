Sadly it solves some problems and creates others :(

Yeah - conceptually all pages in an MTE-enabled guest have tags. It's
just we don't actually populate the physical memory until the guest
tries to touch them. So it makes sense to just return zeros here.
Alternatively we could populate the physical tags but that seems
unnecessary.

Hmm, nothing much. While reads are now fine (the memory won't have
PG_mte_tagged), writes could potentially happen on ZONE_DEVICE memory.

The fix is to just replace pfn_to_page() with pfn_to_online_page() and
handle the error.

I'd seen test_and_set_bit() used elsewhere (I forget where now) as a
slightly more efficient approach. It complies down to a READ_ONCE and a
conditional atomic, vs a single non-conditional atomic. But I don't have
any actual data on the performance and this isn't a hot path, so I'll
switch to the more obvious set_bit().

Yeah it's in case the write fails part way through - we don't want to
expose the tags which were not written. I'll add a comment to explain that.
