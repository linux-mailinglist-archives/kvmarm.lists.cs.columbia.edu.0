Sorry for the late, for it took some time for me to think it over...

Shall we setup a new class of co-processor and use the following id bit 
patterns (assuming the type index to be 0x0016)?

0x6030 <high 16 bits of SMC-CC function ID> 0016 <low 16 bits of SMC-CC 
function ID>

And the value of the co-processor returned to user space can be 0 (KVM 
will not handle) or 1 (KVM will handle)?

We have some D05 which is based on cortex A72 and should support aarch32 
guest. I can take a try.

Our object is to support aarch32 guest on an aarch64 hypervisor, but not 
on an aarch32 hypervisor, isn't it?

The current RFC is not expecting user-space to use set-one-reg to set GP 
registers for returning, to reduce ioctl() invocations for better 
performance.
I didn't use "ret" for guest to hold the returned x0, but still used 
"args[6]" to exchange x0~x5. I agree to set quick path for x0 only, and 
kvm doesn't bother to set the other 5 GP registers.

Thanks a lot,
