Does anyone recall why we need these cap and feature flags for ptrauth
at all?

We have a window before v5.2 where we could remove them, but we need to
get a move on if so...


As I understand it, the main concern here was to support migrations
between nodes that have the same hardware but are running different
kernel versions, thus allowing a new kernel to be deployed across a
cluster without having to stop the world.

Thus, a guest created on an old kernel where KVM doesn's support
ptrauth wouldn't detect the caps and wouldn't set those VCPU_INIT
feature bits: the VCPU_INIT feature set would be recorded in the guest
metadata by userspace and used for creating vcpus on the new node when
migrating, forcing ptrauth still to be hidden from the guest even
if the new node's kernel supports ptrauth for KVM.  Fine.

However, this is equally a problem for other random CPU features, and
we don't handle those at all for now: any feature that the new kernel
supports and is present in the hardware will result in changed CPUID
registers exposed to the guest and thus migration failures.  This
applies even to features that require no KVM supervision whatever.

So migrating between arbitrary kernel versions doesn't work today.
For that, we'd need a way for the CPUID sysregs at the destination
node to values different that the default: we have no logic for that
today.

What problem(s) are we actually trying to solve here?

Do the ptrauth caps and feature flags actually solve anything?


(Note, the SVE case is different: there, the cap and VCPU_INIT flag are
there to work around an ABI break, so that old userspace doesn't see
impossibly-large registers through KVM_GET_ONE_REG etc.)

[...]

Cheers
