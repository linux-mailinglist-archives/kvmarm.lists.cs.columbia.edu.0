KVM will not allow userspace to set the ID register value that conflicts
with CPU features that are configured by the initial KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT
(or there are a few more APIs).
KVM_SET_ONE_REG for such requests will fail.

The answer for this question is basically the same as above.
Userspace is not allowed to enable a feature via the ID registers
which is not present in the bit map.

The cover lever included a brief explanation of this, but I will
try to improve the explanation:-)

Reiji
