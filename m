Fair point - I guess .rst is the way of the future!

This is somewhat embarrassing. Apparently when I was reviewing the new
specification I didn't notice these (subtle) changes. Thanks for
pointing it out to me! I'll update the code to match.

I guess they are generally called "hypercalls" not "hyperfunctions" - so
I'll match the spec here.

True - although the values easily fit in int32 too! But I'll update to
be consistent with the spec.

Will update.
