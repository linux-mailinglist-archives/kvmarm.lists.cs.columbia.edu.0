I mean that when creating the VM, userspace should be able to choose
whether the PTP service is provided to the guest. The host shouldn't
always provide it as there may be cases where doing so is undesireable.

I think it would be very helpful for the commit message and/or cover
letter to have a high-level desctiption of what PTP is meant to do, and
an outline of the algorithmm (clearly splitting the host and guest
bits).

It's also not clear to me what notion of host time is being exposed to
the guest (and consequently how this would interact with time changes on
the host, time namespaces, etc). Having some description of that would
be very helpful.

Thanks,
Mark.
