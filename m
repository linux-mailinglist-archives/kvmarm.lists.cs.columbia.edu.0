Yes I corrected the above statement afterwards, sorry for the noise.

In my understanding that is what virt_kvm_type() was supposed to do by
testing the result of kvm_arm_get_max_vm_ipa_size and requested_pa_size
(which accounted the high regions) and exiting if they were
incompatible. But I must miss something.
