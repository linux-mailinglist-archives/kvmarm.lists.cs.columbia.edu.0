Right, the only guarantee we have on arm64 is that the TLB will never
hold an entry that would produce an access fault.

I have no issues whatsoever with implementing a lock-free walker, we're
already most of the way there with the RCU implementation modulo some
rules for atomic PTE updates. I don't believe lock acquisition is a
bounding issue for us quite yet as break-before-make + lazy splitting
hurts.
