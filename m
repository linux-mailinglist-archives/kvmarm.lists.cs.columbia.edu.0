Sure.
First of all I own different ARM boards. Currently I virtualise on
Banana Pi M1 (1GB), cubox-i (2GB) and my Acer Chromebook (4GB).

The Chromebook is my travel laptop on which I have three VMs on (LAMP,
PostgreSQL, kernel testing) which I primarily use to develop against.

The others are "home servers", they run all kinds of things for my home
(incl. DNS, LDAP, RSS-Reader, Wiki, Music-Database, RDBMS,
Task-Management).

> and how long you will need to upgrade to newer kernels for?

I don't really have a strict policy regarding when to upgrade kernels.
I just run whatever gets patched and works.

Sometimes this is the latest stable release, most of the time this is
the last longterm release.

Not sure if I can answer this question adequately as the smallest of my
ARM32 boards have at least 1GB of RAM, which works for sure.

Since you're asking about the smallest amount I did some experiments.
I spun up the testing VM on my Chromebook. It consists of a basic
Gentoo userland currently running on a "reduced" 4.19 kernel (I'm sure
it could be stripped further if one was determined enough).

When I boot it up and log in the qemu-system process on the host uses
100MB. The memory usage (incl. cache) inside the VM is only 50 MB,
though.

Adding a few MB for the actual application one would want to run to
these 100MB, I calculate with 160MB for a "lightweight" VM.

This would mean that one could run 2-3 such VMs in just 512MB which I
would count as "usable".

If you were conservative with memory and used a lightweight distro, like
Alpine, OpenWrt or built your own using Buildroot, I could imagine that
you can make a nice little home router with virtualized DHCP server,
DNS server (for home network) + resolver, TFTP and possibly VPN in
512MB.
(Sounds like a cool experiment for the next time im bored :P)


A very different use case could be to host unikernels using e.g.
Solo5 (https://github.com/Solo5/solo5) whose hvt backend also uses KVM.
I, unfortunately, don't have any experience with unikernels, but I
assume that they consume a lot less memory than a full Linux VM.

I agree that 4GB seems to be really rare in 32-bit land outside of
laptops like Chromebooks or Novena, but I don't agree that most 32-bit
SBCs are so low specced.

There are quite a few 2GB boards out there:
ODROID U2/U3/X2/XU/XU3/XU4/HC1/HC2, Cubieboard 3/4/5, HummingBoard,
CuBox i4/Pulse, ASUS TinkerBoard (S), Lenovo G66 TV-Box, Radxa ROCK PRO
/ Rock2, Nvidia Jetson TK1, Banana Pi M2U/M3, Firefly RK3288,
BeagleBoard X15, OrangePi Plus 2E, Utilite, Wandboard, ClearFog,
NetGate SC3100, and probably a lot more can be had with 2GB RAM.

(If I were to buy an SBC for virtualization, I'd get one of these :-))

Also lets not forget all the powerful smartphones out there which could
be used as virtualizers using postmarketos.org.

I usually track the latest longterm branch (but I wait a bit before
jumping to a new longterm). So at the moment the majority is running
4.19.x, but I'm in the process of upgrading to 5.4.x now that most of
the annoying bugs should be fixed ;-)

> What is the oldest/newest you run at the moment?

Oldest: 4.15.18 (because of an annoying regression that's likely never
going to get fixed)
Newest: 5.4.20

I could do that, but I would like to avoid being dependent on an old
kernel as from personal experience even on so-called "longterm"
releases regressions do slip in and tend not to get fixed if they're
not too severe, especially in old distro kernels.

Kind regards,
