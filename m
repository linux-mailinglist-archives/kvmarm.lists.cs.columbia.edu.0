I now have a small extension to kvmtool allowing a --pmu-filter option
to be passed on the command line (see [1]).

I've also pushed out an update[2] to the kernel side of things, making
the filtering of the cycle counter consistent and documenting that
neither SW_INCR nor CHAIN could be filtered with this mechanism (but
this is of course up for discussion).

Thanks,
