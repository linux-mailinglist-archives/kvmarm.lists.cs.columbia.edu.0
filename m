IMHO it's still important to investigate all potential users of the dirty
bitmap, like the GIC case.  Because we still want to know how many pages
can be dirtied in maximum that is to be dirtied (even without being able to
know which pages are dirtied from QEMU - or we don't need the bitmap but we
can set them in QEMU dirty bitmaps directly).

The thing is if we will only sync the dirty bitmap during the downtime, it
means there cannot have a large chunk of pages or the downtime is
unpredictable - QEMU will have its own way to calculate the downtime and
predict the best timing to stop the VM on src, however that's happened
before generating these dirty pages on the bitmap at least for GIC case..
So they need to be in small amount.

Sounds reasonable.  We need to make sure that cap:

  - Be enabled before any vcpu creation (just like the ring cap)
  - Can be optional for ring, so e.g. x86 can skip both the last phase sync
    and also creation of the dirty bmap in kernel

Sure.  We can also wait for a few days to see whether Paolo has any input.

OK, I'm not aware the SMMU can also be emulated in the host kernel, thanks
Gavin.  If so then we really need to think as I mentioned above since we
will only sync this when switchover, and if the DMA range can cover a large
portion of guest mem (assuming the physical pages to DMA can be randomly
allocated by guest device drivers) then it may be another problem to cause
drastic downtime.
