Here is an example of the sequences.

 [Usersace]
  | - ioctl(SET_GUEST_DEBUG)
  | - ioctl(KVM_RUN) (vCPU PC==X)
  v
 [KVM]
  | - *vcpu_cpsr(vcpu) |= SPSR_SS;
  | - mdscr |= DBG_MDSCR_SS;
  | - VM Entry
  v
 [Guest] vCPU PC==X
  | - Execute an instruction at PC==X.
  |   PC is updated with X+4, and PSTATE.SS is cleared.
  |
  | !! Asynchronous exception !!
  v
 [KVM] vCPU PC==X+4
  | - The kernel processes the async exception.
  | - handle_exit() returns 1 (don't return to userspace)
  | - *vcpu_cpsr(vcpu) |= SPSR_SS;
  | - mdscr |= DBG_MDSCR_SS;
  | - VM Entry
  v
 [Guest] vCPU PC==X+4
  | - Execute an instruction at PC==X+4.
  |   PC is updated with X+8, PSTATE.SS is cleared.
  |
  | !! Software Step Exception !!
  v
 [KVM] vCPU PC==X+8
  | - run->exit_reason = KVM_EXIT_DEBUG;
  | - Return to userspace
  v
 [Userspace]
    - Userspace sees PC==X+8 (Userspace didn't see PC==X+4).

Setting the SS bit in PSTATE (with MDSCR_EL1.SS=1) makes the state
Active-not-pending (not Active-pending) if my interpretation of
the spec is correct.

MDSCR_EL1.SS is set even in Active-not-pending state (not just
Active-pending state).  (Or do you mean the state is stored in
some other field in MDSCR ??)

Yes, that is what I was referring to.
In "Figure D2-3 Software step state machine" in Arm ARM (DDI 0487I.a),
since KVM currently sets PSTATE.SS to 1 on every Guest Entry (when
single-step is enabled by userspace), KVM always has the CPU in
"Inactive" (the second inactive state from the top) transition to
"Active-not-pending" on the Guest Entry.  With this patch, KVM
have the CPU transitions to "Active-pending" if the state before
"Inactive" was "Active-pending", which indicates the step completed
but Software Step exception is not taken yet, so that Software
Step exception is taken before further single-step is executed.

I'm sorry for the unclear explanation, and
I hope my comments clarify the problem I'm trying to fix.

Thank you,
Reiji
