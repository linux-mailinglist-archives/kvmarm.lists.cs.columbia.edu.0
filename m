Isn't that an important distinction from a cloud service provider's 
perspective?

As far as I understand it, you also need CPU hotplug capabilities to 
support things like Kata runtime under Kubernetes. i.e. when 
implementing your containers in the form of light weight VMs for the 
additional security ... and the orchestration layer cannot determine 
ahead of time how much CPU/memory resources are going to be needed to 
run the pod(s).
