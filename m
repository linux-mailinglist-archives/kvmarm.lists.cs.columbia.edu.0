The Arm SMCCC is rather prescriptive in regards to the allocation of
SMCCC function ID ranges. Many of the hypercall ranges have an
associated specification from Arm (FF-A, PSCI, SDEI, etc.) with some
room for vendor-specific implementations.

The ever-expanding hypercall surface leaves a lot of work within KVM for
providing new features. Furthermore, KVM implements its own
vendor-specific ABI, leaving little room for other implementations (like
Hyper-V, for example).

This series takes a stab at both by allowing SMCCC ranges to shunt to
userspace. The meat of the UAPI is a bitmap (conveyed through a VM
capability) that creates trap bits for known SMCCC ranges. Exits are
done by reusing the KVM_EXIT_HYPERCALL interface, with its hilariously
x86-specific kvm_run structure (no longmode here!)

=> We have these new hypercall bitmap registers, why not use that?

The hypercall bitmap registers aren't necessarily aimed at the same
problem. The bitmap registers allow a VMM to preserve the ABI the guest
gets from KVM by default when migrating between hosts. By default KVM
exposes the entire feature set to the guest, whereas user hypercalls
need explicit opt-in from userspace.

TODO:
 - SMCCC_ARCH_FEATURES is pitifully overloaded to allow discovery of
   paravirtualized time features. Queries to SMCCC_ARCH_FEATURES against
   PV time should go to userspace if userspace has PV time trapped.

 - May want to use a completion on reentry for propagating the return
   value to avoid extra ioctls (SMCCC calls can return more than a
   single register value).

Tossing up on the list as an RFC to gauge interest in such an interface.
Gently tested with the included selftest and that's about it.

Applies to v6.1-rc3 + the header relocation [1]. No firm reason for it
besides the fact that I initially did the refactoring as part of this
series and am too lazy to rebase.
