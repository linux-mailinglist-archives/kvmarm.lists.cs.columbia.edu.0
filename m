Using the set/get_user hooks of the sysreg table we can accept a user
input PMCR_EL0. We would only accept one that matches what the hardware
and KVM supports though (EINVAL otherwise). We'll need to modify reset to
use the value selected by the user too, which we can store in 'val' of the
sysreg table.

Since userspace will likely get before set in order to know what's valid,
we'll need to provide the current reset state on get until it has been
set. I'm not sure how to track whether it has been set or not. Maybe new
state is needed or an initial val=0 or val=~0 may work.

Thanks,
drew
