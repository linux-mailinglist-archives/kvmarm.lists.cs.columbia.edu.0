Then the follow up (pure) question is what will happen if we simply
propagate the no-exec permission into the child SP?

I think that only happens with direct sptes where guest used huge pages
because that's where the shadow page will be huge, so IIUC that's checked
here when the small page fault triggers:

static void validate_direct_spte(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, u64 *sptep,
				   unsigned direct_access)
{
	if (is_shadow_present_pte(*sptep) && !is_large_pte(*sptep)) {
		struct kvm_mmu_page *child;

		/*
		 * For the direct sp, if the guest pte's dirty bit
		 * changed form clean to dirty, it will corrupt the
		 * sp's access: allow writable in the read-only sp,
		 * so we should update the spte at this point to get
		 * a new sp with the correct access.
		 */
		child = to_shadow_page(*sptep & PT64_BASE_ADDR_MASK);
		if (child->role.access == direct_access)
			return;

		drop_parent_pte(child, sptep);
		kvm_flush_remote_tlbs_with_address(vcpu->kvm, child->gfn, 1);
	}
}

Due to missing EXEC the role.access check will not match with direct
access, which is the guest pgtable value which has EXEC set.  Then IIUC
we'll simply drop the no-exec SP and replace it with a new one with exec
perm.  The question is, would that untimately work too?

Even if that works, I agree this sounds tricky because we're potentially
caching fake sp.role conditionally and it seems we never do that before.
It's just that the other option that you proposed here seems to add other
way of complexity on caching spte permission information while kvm doesn't
do either before.  IMHO we need to see which is the best trade off.

I could have missed something else, though.

Thanks,
