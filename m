Just wanted to revisit this...

Ryan, you say that it is possible for hardware to support LPA2 for a
single stage of translation. Are you basing that statement on something
in the Arm ARM or the fact that there are two different enumerations
for stage-1 and stage-2?

In my cursory search I wasn't able to find anything that would suggest
it is possible for only a single stage to implement the feature. The one
possibility I can think of is the NV case, where the L0 hypervisor for
some reason does not support LPA2 in its emulated stage-2 but still
advertises support for LPA2 at stage-1. I'd say that's quite a stupid
L0, but I should really hold my tongue until KVM actually does NV ;-)

I want to make sure there is a strong sense of what LPA2 means in terms
of the architecture to inform how we use it in KVM.
