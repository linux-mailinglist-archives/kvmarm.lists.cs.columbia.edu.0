Hello,

It's not clear to me why this patch is needed. If one VCPU in the VM is generating
code, is it not the software running in the VM responsible for keeping track of
the MMU state of the other VCPUs and making sure the new code is executed
correctly? Why should KVM get involved?

I don't see how this is different than running on bare metal (no hypervisor), and
one CPU with the MMU on generates code that another CPU with the MMU off must execute.

Some comments below.

FEAT_FWB requires that CLIDR_EL1.{LoUIS, LoUU} = {0, 0} which means that no dcache
clean is required for instruction to data coherence (page D13-3086). I interpret
that as saying that with FEAT_FWB, CTR_EL0.IDC is effectively 1, which means that
dcache clean is not required for instruction generation, and icache invalidation
is required only if CTR_EL0.DIC = 0 (according to B2-158).

Nitpicking, but SCTLR_EL1.M == 0 and SCTLR_EL1.I == 1 means that instruction
fetches are to Normal Cacheable, Inner and Outer Read-Allocate memory (ARM DDI
0487G.a, pages D5-2709 and indirectly at D13-3586).

Like you've pointed out, as mentioned in D4.4.6, it is always possible that
instruction fetches are held in the instruction cache, regardless of the state of
the SCTLR_EL1.M bit.

When FEAT_FWB, CTR_EL0.IDC is effectively 1 (see above), so we don't need a dcache
clean in this case.

Thanks,
