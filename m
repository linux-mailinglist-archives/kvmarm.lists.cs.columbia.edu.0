Somewhat...

The guest is assigning memory from the IPA space to back the ITS tables,
but KVM maintains its own internal representation. It just so happens
that we've conditioned userspace to be aware that ITS emulation is
incoherent w.r.t. the guest memory that backs the tables.

I think the SAVE_TABLES ioctl is likely here to stay given the odd quirk
that it really is guest memory, so we'll probably need the bitmap on
arm64 for a long time. Even if we were to kill it, userspace would need
to take a change anyway to switch to a new ITS migration mechanism.

If we ever get to the point that we can relax this restriction i think a
flag on the BITMAP_WITH_TABLE cap that says "I don't actually set any
bits in the bitmap" would do. We shouldn't hide the cap entirely, as
that would be ABI breakage for VMMs that expect bitmap+ring.

Thoughts?
