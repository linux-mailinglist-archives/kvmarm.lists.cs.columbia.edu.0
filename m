Good spot - sorry about that. I really must get better at reading my own 
commit messages.

pte_access_permitted() looks like it describes what we want (user space 
can access the memory). I'll add the following comment:

  /*
   * If the PTE would provide user space will access to the tags
   * associated with it then ensure that the MTE tags are synchronised.
   * Exec-only mappings don't expose tags (instruction fetches don't
   * check tags).
   */

It comes down to the behaviour of get_user_pages(). AFAICT that will 
fail if the memory is exec-only, so no stage 2 mapping will be created. 
Which of course means the guest can't do anything with that memory. That 
certainly seems like the only sane behaviour even without MTE.

Good point - I'll change that to a straight set_bit().

That is my understanding - either the PTL is held or the page is locked. 
But I am aware I was partly basing that on an assumption that the 
existing code is correct. If there's a way that a new PTE can be created 
which races with the arch_swap_restore() path then there is a problem. 
I'm not aware of how that would happen though.
