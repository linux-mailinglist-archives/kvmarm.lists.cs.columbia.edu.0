FWIW, I didn't subscribe until just now because there weren't clear
instructions on the linked page. For everyone else's benefit, to subscribe you
need to send a mail to:

  kvmarm+subscribe@lists.linux.dev

... with any subject and body. You'll then get a confirmation email that you
need to reply to.

Thanks,
Mark.
