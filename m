[added kvm-arm to the cc list; the kernel folks tend to hang out
there, not on qemu-devel, so KVM related questions are usually
worth raising there as well.]

Yep. The kernel doesn't support "give me a CPU that looks like
a Cortex-A72".

Untested, but I assume that -cpu cortex-a53 works on the A53...

...and fails on the A72 host.

This would be wrong -- it would mean that you could tell QEMU "give
me a guest CPU that's a Cortex-A72" and it would not error on
non-A72 hardware but not actually give a guest CPU that looks
like a Cortex-A72.

 * If what you want is "give me something that works" then that's
   -cpu host or -cpu max.

 * If what you want is "give me something that's always this kind of
   CPU regardless of the host hardware" then that's a lot of kernel
   dev work nobody's been enthusiastic enough to undertake yet
   (notably the "what do we do about CPU errata workarounds" question
   would need to be solved...)

 * If what you want is "allow me to say '-cpu cortex-a72' and have
   it work on an A72 host and not anywhere else" then I guess we could
   implement that on the QEMU side by querying the MIDR and checking
   whether it was what we expected.

>   - alternatively drop the explicit settings for A57/A53

These explicit settings are correct, because for these CPUs
the kernel does have a "give me what I want in particular"
setting (which it will fail on the wrong h/w), and also as
back-compat for older kernels that predate the GENERIC_V8
define and only recognize the explicit "give me an A53" value.

Not sure why you care about this -- it's an implementation
detail of the TCG handling of the 'max' CPU. There's an argument
for disentangling TCG 'max' so it's not literally implemented
as "a57 plus newer stuff", granted.

thanks
