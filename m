I am not sure if the following is implied above.

   1) Against the "snapshot" state, where mismatches triggers updating
      the "snapshot" state to reflect the "safe" value.

   2) Compared against the CPU feature registers of *the boot CPU* for
     "FTR_STRICT" fields and any mismatch triggers TAINT_CPU_OUT_OF_SPEC.
      This makes sure that warning is generated for each OUT_OF_SPEC
      secondary CPU.

As mentioned above, this check is against that of the "boot CPU"
register state, which may not be implicit from the statement.

As you mentioned in the other response we could add information about
the guest view, something like :

       - KVM exposes the sanitised value of the feature registers to the
	guests and is not affected by the FTR_VISIBLE. However,
	depending on the individual feature support in the hypervisor,
	some of the fields may be capped/limited.

Cheers
Suzuki
