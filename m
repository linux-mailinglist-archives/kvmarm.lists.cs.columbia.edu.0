That's a good point :).

I am happy with the renaming here.

I am fine with this suggestion.

I will have a look.

Yes we are. This made me realize that Linux-RT replaced the preempt_disable() in 
the caller by migrate_disable(). The latter will prevent the task to move to 
another CPU but allow preemption.

This patch will likely makes things awfully broken for Linux-RT. I will have a 
look to see if we can call this from preempt notifier.

I guess you mean we need to do this for VHE system. If so, I agree that 
cpu_init_hyp_mode() is not the best place. I will move it to cpu_hyp_reinit().

Fair point. I will update the next version.
