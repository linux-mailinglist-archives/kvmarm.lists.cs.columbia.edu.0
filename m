Typo on my part, thank you for spotting it.

I chose to set at the VCPU level to be consistent with how KVM treats the
PMU interrupt ID when the interrupt is a PPI, where the interrupt ID must
be the same for all VCPUs and it is stored at the VCPU. However, looking at
the code again, it occurs to me that it is stored at the VCPU when it's a
PPI because it's simpler to do it that way, as the code remains the same
when the interrupt ID is a SPI, which must be *different* between VCPUs. So
in the end, having the PMU stored at the VM level does match how KVM uses
it, which looks to be better than my approach.

This is the change you proposed in your branch [1]:

+static int kvm_arm_pmu_v3_set_pmu(struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu, int pmu_id)
+{
+       struct kvm *kvm = vcpu->kvm;
+       struct arm_pmu_entry *entry;
+       struct arm_pmu *arm_pmu;
+       int ret = -ENXIO;
+
+       mutex_lock(&kvm->lock);
+       mutex_lock(&arm_pmus_lock);
+
+       list_for_each_entry(entry, &arm_pmus, entry) {
+               arm_pmu = entry->arm_pmu;
+               if (arm_pmu->pmu.type == pmu_id) {
+                       /* Can't change PMU if filters are already in place */
+                       if (kvm->arch.arm_pmu != arm_pmu &&
+                           kvm->arch.pmu_filter) {
+                               ret = -EBUSY;
+                               break;
+                       }
+
+                       kvm->arch.arm_pmu = arm_pmu;
+                       ret = 0;
+                       break;
+               }
+       }
+
+       mutex_unlock(&arm_pmus_lock);
+       mutex_unlock(&kvm->lock);
+       return ret;
+}

As I understand the code, userspace only needs to call
KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_CTRL(KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_PMU) *once* (on one VCPU
fd) to set the PMU for all the VCPUs; subsequent calls (on the same VCPU or
on another VCPU) with a different PMU id will change the PMU for all VCPUs.

Two remarks:

1. The documentation for the VCPU ioctls states this (from
Documentation/virt/kvm/devices/vcpu.rst):

"
======================
Generic vcpu interface
======================

The virtual cpu "device" also accepts the ioctls KVM_SET_DEVICE_ATTR,
KVM_GET_DEVICE_ATTR, and KVM_HAS_DEVICE_ATTR. The interface uses the same struct
kvm_device_attr as other devices, but **targets VCPU-wide settings and
controls**" (emphasis added).

But I guess having VCPU ioctls affect *only* the VCPU hasn't really been
true ever since PMU event filtering has been added. I'll send a patch to
change that part of the documentation for arm64.

I was thinking maybe a VM capability would be better suited for changing a
VM-wide setting, what do you think? I don't have a strong preference either
way.

2. What's to stop userspace to change the PMU after at least one VCPU has
run? That can be easily observed by the guest when reading PMCEIDx_EL0.
