Might be - I just find it handy when looking for  related details.

That's true, though this is a lightweight way of resetting the vcpu state.
We would have to do that otherwise to mark that this case has been handled
and that the abort is no longer pending.

That's the problem. that would not happen on a real hardware.
We might end up here due to a KVM bug (which has been fixed recently)
when the injected
abort is not the one expected (as of not the one that would be
triggered by hw in this
particular case).

You have a point here, this can indeed be exploited by the malicious
guest. Not sure if killing it is necessary here.
I could limit the logging though that gets tricky for aborts triggered by
user-space processes which would probably leave the guest running
without much of an issue there.
I can y get rid of logging the additional info and keep the single
statement of an instruction not being emulated but that still leaves an
open door for potential exploits...

The function is attempting to inject the external data abort. The rest is for
the aftermath analysis to easy figuring out what has happened
which will not be so easy in case of user-space process triggering
the DABT with no valid ISS. There is no attempt of emulating the instruction
just simply saying the guest tried to access this address with this instruction
which couldn't be handled. Might be excessive in some cases
(like misbehaving kernel) but it also might be handy on those rare
occasions when there is not much to analyze.
But as per the issue you have raised above I will rework that.

Not sure if there is a mechanism to specify the 'preferred' behavior though.
