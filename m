First of all, thank you for your time and providing your comments continuously.
Since the series is tagged as RFC, it's not a surprise to see something is
obviously broken. However, Could you please provide more details? With more
details, I can figure out the solutions. If I'm correct, you're talking about
the added entry code and the injected PV hooks. Anyway, please provide more
details about your concerns so that I can figure out the solutions.

Let me briefly explain why we need the injected PV hooks in ret_to_user: There
are two fashions of wakeup and I would call them as direct wakeup and delayed
wakeup. The sleeping process is waked up directly when received PAGE_READY
notification from the host, which is the process of direct wakeup. However there
are some cases the direct wakeup can't be carried out. For example, the sleeper
and the waker are same process or the (CFS) runqueue has been locked by somebody
else. In these cases, the wakeup is delayed until the idle process is running or
in ret_to_user. It's how delayed wakeup works.

Yep, I agree there are several cleanup patches can be posted separately
and merged in advance. I will do that and thanks for the comments.

About the shared code between arm64/x86, I need some time to investigate.
Basically, I agree to do so. I also included Paolo here to check his opnion.

It's no doubt these are all preparatory work, to make the review a bit
easier as you said :)

Yes, sure. I will do this in the future. Sorry about having taken you
too much to do the reverse-engineering. In next revision, I might put
more information in the cover letter and commit log to explain how things
are designed and working :)

Yeah, I agree it's far from a realistic workload. However, it's the test case
which was suggested when async page fault was proposed from day one, according
to the following document. On the page#34, you can see the benchmark, which is
similar to what we're doing.

https://www.linux-kvm.org/images/a/ac/2010-forum-Async-page-faults.pdf

Ok. I will test with the workload to build kernel or another better one to
represent the case.

Yes, It's the pure overhead, which is mainly contributed by the injected
PV code in ret_to_user.
