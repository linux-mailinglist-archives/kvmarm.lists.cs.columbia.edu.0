By "made useless" I mean that after that commit phys_end has no influence
on the way setup_mmu() creates the translation tables.

Yes, it's a problem because on real hardware or with kvmtool, which allows
the user to specify where RAM starts, the test can be loaded at the same
address from where vmalloc() will start allocating memory. But I think that
should be fixed separately from this series, maybe as part of the main
UEFI series, or as a separate patch(es).

I'll drop this patch, and leave any cleanups for when the vmalloc area
change is implemented.

Thanks,
Alex
