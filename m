Hi

I found this mailing list thread and would like to express my opinion
and dependence on KVM/arm32.

I hope that I'm not too late already.

I might not be an important user, but I have been for multiple years
and still am a regular user of KVM/arm32 on different devices.

I use KVM on my Tegra K1 Chromebook for app development and have
multiple SBCs at home on which I run VMs on using KVM+libvirt.

Sure, neither of these devices has many resources available, but they
are working fine. I would love to keep them in service since I haven't
found arm64-based replacements that don't require hours upon hours of
tinkering to just get a basic OS installation running with a mainline
kernel.

As an example that they can still be of use in 2020 I'd like to point
out that one of the SBCs is running my DNS resolver, LDAP server,
RSS reader, IRC bouncer, and shared todo list just fine, each in their
separate VM.

This assumption is deeply flawed. Most users (including me) are not
subscribed to this mailing list and will never find this thread at all.
I myself stumbled upon this discussion just by chance while I was
browsing the web trying to find something completely unrelated.

I've been using KVM on x86, ppc and arm for many years, yet I never
felt the need to report a bug on the mailing list.
(This is to be interpreted as a compliment to the great work the devs
of KVM have done!)

Just going by the number of bugs reported on a developers mailing list
is not going to paint an accurate picture.

I am convinced that I'm not the only one relying on KVM/arm32 in the
mainline kernel and would ask you to please reconsider keeping arm32 in
the mainline kernel for a few more years until adequate arm64
replacements are available on the market and have gained proper support
in the mainline kernel.

I myself unfortunately do neither have the knowledge nor resources to
help with development in KVM or maintaining a non-mainline kernel.

Thanks for your understanding.

Kind regards
