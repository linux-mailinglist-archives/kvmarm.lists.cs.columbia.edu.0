Sorry, somehow I managed to get myself confused and didn't realize that
this is only used by KVM.

What I said above about the possibility of software existing that pokes IMP
DEF registers when PMUVer = 0xf is in fact a good argument for this patch,
because KVM injects an undefined exception when a guest tries to access
such registers.

Thanks,
Alex
