I found some time to go through the series, and there is clearly a lot
of work left to do:

- There so nothing here to handle memory pinning whatsoever. If it
  works, it is only thanks to some side effect.

- The missing trapping is deeply worrying. Given that this is an
  optional feature, you cannot just let the guest do whatever it wants
  in an uncontrolled manner.

- The interrupt handling is busted. You mix concepts picked from both
  the PMU and the timer code, while the SPE device doesn't behave like
  any of these two (it is neither a fully emulated device, nor a
  device that is exclusively owned by a guest at any given time).

I expect some level of discussion on the list including at least Will
and myself before you respin this.
