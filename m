You're right that we could get away with not knowing the shadowed
access permissions to assign to the child SPTEs when splitting a huge
SPTE. We could just copy the huge SPTE access permissions and then let
the execute bit be repaired on fault (although those faults would be a
performance cost).

But the access permissions are also needed to lookup an existing
shadow page (or create a new shadow page) to use to split the huge
page. For example, let's say we are going to split a huge page that
does not have execute permissions enabled. That could be because NX
HugePages are enabled or because we are shadowing a guest translation
that does not allow execution (or both). We wouldn't want to propagate
the no-execute permission into the child SP role.access if the
shadowed translation really does allow execution (and vice versa).

Good catch. I will need to dig into this more to confirm but I think
you might be right.

I was going for the theoretical maximum number of bits for a GFN. But
that would be 64 - 12 = 52... so I'm not sure what I was thinking
here.

I'll switch it to 52 and add a comment.
