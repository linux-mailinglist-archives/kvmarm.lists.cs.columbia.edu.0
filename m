That would be asking for a -cpu max, though, not for an A53.

That list is supposed to contain "all CPUs which might be
present on a host kernel which doesn't support the
PREFERRED_TARGET ioctl". That ioctl went in in Linux kernel
commit 42c4e0c77ac91, and in a kernel source tree
"git show 42c4e0c77ac91:arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h"
tells us that indeed at that point the only 3 CPUs supported
were AEM_V8, FOUNDATION_V8 and CORTEX_A57. Once the host
kernel supported the PREFERRED_TARGET ioctl, we could query
it to ask "what kind of CPU are you?" in that function rather
than having to guess.

(we don't overwrite them, we augment them.)

At this point I'd take another step backwards and ask
"why are you trying to add a new CPU?". Are you after a
TCG emulation of it, or are you trying to use KVM? If you're
using KVM, generally QEMU is set up so you don't need to tell
it about new CPU types at all. Mostly the cpu definitions for
specific CPUs in cpu64.c are there because we want them for TCG.
