The copy is also needed in __kvm_set_memory_region() for the MOVE case.

As above, it's more subtle than just the kvm_delete_memslot() case.

	/*
	 * Make a full copy of the old memslot, the pointer will become stale
	 * when the memslots are re-sorted by update_memslots() when deleting
	 * or moving a memslot, and additional modifications to the old memslot
	 * need to be made after calling update_memslots().
