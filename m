Sorry, got confused about what you were asking. The next patch removes the
smp_wmb() from stats_reset() which became redundant after the barriers added to
the GIC functions that send IPIs. This patch is about removing barriers that were
never needed in the first place because the functions were running on the same
CPU, it's not dependent on anyGIC changes.

Thanks,
Alex
