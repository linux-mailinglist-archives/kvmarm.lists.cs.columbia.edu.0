That's probably a design mistake, correct :)

Sounds like an easy thing to resolve using kvm-unit-tests?

I think we're converging here. My proposal is that "inject a fault" 
should not be something special cased for the "I can't decode the 
instruction" case, but rather that we need a more generic mechanism.

Whether that's a new ioctl, a flag we set on entry or something else is 
an implementation detail I'll be happy to leave for discussion.

The only thing I'd like to avoid seeing is that we create a new user 
space ABI that makes it easy to inject a single, particular exception, 
but not solve all of the other cases while creating extra work to just 
implement instruction decoding in user space.
