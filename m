Yes I think this is odd too - indeed when I initially wrote this I
missed off the kfree() call and had to track down the memory leak.

When I looked into potentially tiding this up I found some other
oddities, e.g. "kvm-xive" (arch/powerpc/kvm/book3s_xive.c) doesn't have
a destroy callback. But I can't see anything in the common code which
deals with that case. So I decided to just "go with the flow" at the
moment, since I don't understand how some of these existing devices work
(perhaps they are already broken?).
