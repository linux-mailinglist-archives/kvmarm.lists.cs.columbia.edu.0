You missed the arch code's apei_claim_sea(). This is where kvm washes its hands of the
exception, its up to the arch code to deal with, in the same way it deals with errors for
user-space.

The other kind is _asynchronous_ external abort, which doesn't get handled in here.

Do you mean 'Synchronous external abort on translation table walk, nth level'?
KVM shouldn't care, this is still up to the arch code to deal with.

Do you mean 'Synchronous parity or ECC error on memory access, not on translation table
walk'? (and all its translation table walk friends...)

These really are still external abort!
See shared/functions/aborts/IsExternalAbort() in the psuedo code. (J12-7735 of DDI0487F.a)

This means they are trapped by SCR_EL3.EA. On a firmware-first system if we see one of
these, its because firmware re-injected it. The arch code needs to get APEI to check for
CPER records when it sees one. (KVM ... doesn't care)

(I agree not having 'external' in the name is counter-intuitive. I think this is because
the component that triggers them is 'in' the CPU, (e.g. the L1 cache). This is how you can
know it was a parity or ECC error, instead of 'something outside' (i.e. external). An OS
that is deeply tied to the CPU micro-architecture could use the difference to read imp-def
sysregs for one, and poke around in imp-def mmio for the external case. Linux isn't tied
to the micro-architecture, so ignores this 'internal/external' hint.)

In what circumstances does this happen?

Wouldn't these errors all be uncontained? (in which case the host should panic()).
e.g. A write went to the wrong address, we don't know where it went...

...

Is this because your platform describes memory-errors that happen inside the CPU as
processor errors, instead of memory-errors?

Linux's APEI code ignores them, because it doesn't know what they are. This means you are
missing the whole memory_failure(), page-unmapping, user-space signalling ... and guest
error injection ... part of the RAS handling.

Not at all. The SError here is KVM's response to having nothing else it can do.

Having the host handle the error is the best way of solving the problem.

I'd rather we fix this by having the host handle the error.

Botching in a synchronous exception here would mean Qemu can't properly emulate a machine
that has SCR_EL3.EA set ... which you need to provide firmware-first for the guest.

I don't think its reasonable to expect KVM to do anything useful in this case.
We should fix the host error handling.

In what circumstances does this happen?


Thanks,

James
