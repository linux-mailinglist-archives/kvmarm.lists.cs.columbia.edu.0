Thanks for the thoroughness here.  I also wasn't able to produce an
error on the model, so I think we can conclude that it's at least no
worse than the original code, and since we all agree that this should be
correct, then I think it's fair that Marc has merged the patch.

It can't hurt to post the code you wrote for the test; someone might
pick that up in the future to test something similar.


Thanks,
