Unreleased one

Thanks. I'll try to see if I can backport some of that.

That said, if you remember my previous email, we got the kernel
external hypervisor going. I have multiple kernel versions running OK
(4.9 ... 5.4) under the external hypervisor. It will still need some
polishing rounds and security related work, but in general it seems to
run fine. 95%+ of the kvmarm code is intact and I suppose if this kind
of thing is of interest to others, we could present the work and
potentially some of the hooks required in the kvm code to make it all
run for others, too. The guest and the host can both be VMs and the
guests can be just untouchable holes in the host memory. Kind of like
AMD SEV, just no encryption needed.
