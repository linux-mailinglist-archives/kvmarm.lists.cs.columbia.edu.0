Nailed it. Of course, before anything starts writing from C code, we 
need
to have initialised KASAN. kasan_init.c itself is compiled without any
address sanitising, but we can't repaint all the stuff that is called
from early_fdt_map() (quite a lot).

So the natural thing to do is to keep kasan_early_init() as the first
thing we do in C code, and everything falls from that.

Any chance you could try that on top and see if that cures your problem?
If that works for you, I'll push an updates series.

Thanks,

         M.
