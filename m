Ah well, I can be wrong twice.  Or even three times.

Yes, that looks reasonable.  Basically, in 6bc210003dff we should have
only removed the call to timer_emulate, and not messed around with
kvm_timer_update_irq()?

After this patch, we'll have moved the call to kvm_timer_update_irq()
from kvm_arm_timer_set_reg() to kvm_arm_timer_write_sysreg().  I can't
seem to decide if clearly belongs in one place or the other.

Thanks,
