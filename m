"Traditionally" the first field of a variable length structure like this
has the size.  So maybe this needs to be:

struct kvm_stats_header {
	__u32 header_size;
	__u32 name_size;
	__u32 num_desc;
	__u32 desc_offset;
	__u32 data_offset;
	char id[];
};

I just guessed at what "count" is as I do not remember at the moment,
but obviously "count" wasn't descriptive :)

Wait, what is "name_size" here for?

So it's specified in the _previous_ header?  That feels wrong, shouldn't
this descriptor define what is in it?

I'm not trying to nit-pick here, I'm actually confused now.  Structures
that contain "headers" should have in those headers at least two things:
	- declare the size of themselves if they are variable length
	- declare offsets to other structures

Don't put a size in this header for the size of a later structure,
that's just extra complexity that is not needed.

Think of this as a stream of bytes across the wire like a hardware
descriptor.  We have loads of experience dealing with this with
protocols like USB and Greybus and PCI and the like.  Let's learn from
those experiences and not try to mess things up where we don't need to
:)

Is that what v4l and drm do today?  That's still safer and more
"obvious" than trying to keep two different files in sync which, as I
well know, almost impossible to do well over the _years_ in which you
will have to maintain these files.

Let's make it easier for everyone, put it only in one place and if
people want to see the documentation, they can generate it (it's
auto-generated on kernel.org anyway), no need to worry about multiple
passes or not.

thanks,
