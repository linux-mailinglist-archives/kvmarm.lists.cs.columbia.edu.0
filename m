Hi,

(They both caused an exit!)

EC is the 'Exception Class'. Exit is KVM/Linux's terminology.

I assume we do it this way so there is only one guest-exit tracepoint that catches all exits.
I don't think its a problem if user-space has to know the EC isn't set for asynchronous
exceptions, this is a property of the architecture and anything using these trace-points
is already arch specific.

Because the existing tracepoints are ABI, I don't think we can change them.

We can add new ones if there is something that a user reasonably needs to trace, and can't
be done any other way.

What can't 'perf kvm stat' do with the existing trace points?

Why are there two? Are you using this to benchmark the exit_handler()?

As we can't remove the EC from the exit event, I don't think this tells us anything new.

Why do you need the PC? It was exported on exit.
(its mostly junk for user-space anyway, you can't infer anything from it)


Thanks,
