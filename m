Yeah, that's definitely overkill.

I agree with your position; we can solve the issue altogether by
enforcing ordering on the hypercall registers. Userspace should read
all hypercall registers to discover features, then write them. Given
your suggestion, I don't know if there is much need for the guesswork
to conclude on an appropriate register size for the hypercall bitmaps.
64 bits seems fine to me..
