There are multiple things at play here:

- if the system is a host, the kernel will use CNTPCT. Userspace will
  still use CNTVCT, and the offset is guaranteed to be 0 *when running
  userspace*.

- if the system isn't a host (which doesn't necessarily means a
  guest), CNTVCT is the only thing that is being used, and the offset
  is unknown (Linux requires it to be constant across vcpus though).

So I doubt you'd get a bad timestamp on the host. It is just that you
have named your trace clock incorrectly (and Steven's idea of an
indirected clock could help here).

We want to minimise the chance for an observable rollover of the
virtual counter, so time starts at 0 *in the guest*. The VMM can
change the view of that time for the purpose of migration.

If you want a 0 offset, set the counter to the physical value in the
VMM (imprecise) or have a look at Oliver Upton's patches that were
allowing an offset to be specified directly. But migration, by
definition, breaks this.

The PTP clock does exactly that from the guest PoV, with a lot more
overhead, and this results in single digit ns precision. Why isn't
that possible from userspace?
