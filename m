This patch makes sense to me: when FWB is available, the guest memory is cacheable
even when the stage 1 MMU is disabled, which means it's now impossible to have a
situation where the data in memory is newer than the data in the cache.

I tested the patch with the fix suggested by Marc by doing a linux boot and then a
'ls -R /', and by running kvm-unit-tests in a loop a couple dozen times. For what
it's worth:

Tested-by: Alexandru Elisei <alexandru.elisei@arm.com>

I do need to point out that I haven't been able to make a guest misbehave when FWB
is not enabled *and* KVM doesn't do a stage2_flush_vm when the stage 1 MMU is
enabled. I tried to write two different tests in kvm-unit-tests:

1. With the MMU never enabled, the test tells the host to read a value from memory
(so a cache line is allocated), writes another value to the same memory location,
and then enables the MMU and reads the memory back. I always got the latest value
that was written while the MMU was off.

2. One thread tells the host to read the memory location in a loop (to make sure
that the cache line doesn't get evicted), while the other thread writes a value
with the MMU off, enables the MMU and reads the memory back. I still got the
latest value written with the MMU off.

I can share the source code for the tests, if anyone is interested; I'm also open
to other suggestions.

Regards,
Alex
