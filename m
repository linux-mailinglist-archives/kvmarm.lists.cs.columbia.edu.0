Indeed, I oversaw that one. I'll fix it and repost it together with
the extra patches to handle TID1 and TID2.

Holy cow! I'm afraid that my newly acquired QEMU-foo is missing
a few key options. Does it mean we need to generate a trapping
instruction, as opposed to take the exception on access?

I'd very much appreciate some guidance here.

Thanks,
