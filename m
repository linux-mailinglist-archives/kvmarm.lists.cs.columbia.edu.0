Yes, this is how I understood it.

But if userspace created the memslots with memory already set with
PROT_MTE, then this wouldn't be necessary, right? And, as long as
there's still a way to access the memory with tag checking disabled,
then it shouldn't be a problem.

Hmm, so there's no easy way to disable tag checking when necessary? If we
don't map the guest ram with PROT_MTE and continue setting the attribute
in KVM, as this series does, then we don't need to worry about it tag
checking when accessing the memory, but then we can't access the tags for
migration.

It would require num-set-bits * host-page-size / 16 / 2, right?

So if I understand correctly this would allow us to map the guest memory
with PAGE_MTE and still access the memory when needed. If so, then this
sounds interesting.
