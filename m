Heh, still have a bit of a headache from this :)

I'm having a hard time following where we skip the EL2 promotion based
on __boot_cpu_mode.

On the cpu_resume() path it looks like we take the return of
init_kernel_el() and pass that along to finalise_el2(). As we are in EL1
at this point, it seems like we'd go init_kernel_el() -> init_el1().

What am I missing?
