I was trying to avoid talking about the consequences of a mismatch in that

Do you think something is missing here?

Hmm, I'm trying to figure out if this matters. I suppose this means you
get a SANITY CHECK warning for every mismatching secondary CPU, but that's
implied by the above. Is there something else I'm missing?

In light of Marc's comment, I'll add something here along the lines of:

  "KVM exposes its own view of the feature registers to guest operating
   systems regardless of FTR_VISIBLE. This is typically driven from the
   sanitised register values to allow virtual CPUs to be migrated between
   arbitrary physical CPUs, but some features not present on the host are
   also advertised and emulated. Look at sys_reg_descs[] for the gory
   details."
