IIUC, (d) would fall under state (c) as the switch to the vcpu's user
task will have set the TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE bit after saving the previous
task's state in fpsimd_thread_switch, as you hoped.

Thank you for the detailed reply, it's given me some very helpful

This suggestion looks like a nicer way of writing the current behaviour.
The code at the moment checks the TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE bit in
update_fp_enabled and clears the host flag if it is set. So it doesn't
appear to be buggy but this would be a nice patch.

The record keeping is a little strange. In this handler, the FP_ENABLED
flag gets set and then, on exit to the host, kvm_arch_vcpu_ctxsync_fp
binds the vcpu FPSIMD state.

I've assumed that the vcpu state will remain enabled and the trap
disabled until the next exit to host. Maybe that is too brittle an
assumption to make?

I'm not familiar with the different contexts required for these updates
so I'll have to do a bit more learning to saw anything meaningful on
this one!

This makes sense. At the very least I hope to add some explanation to
aid future readers if there aren't any simplification that can be made.
