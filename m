Maybe use .rst instead of .txt?

The spec calls this PV_TIME_FEATURES.

This is 0xC5000021 in the spec.

The spec calls this PV_call_id, but maybe PV_func_id would have been better.

This is an int64 in the spec.

The spec version is 1.0 and Table 1 says "For implementations compliant
with this revision of the specification...". So I think this description
should be "Must be 0 for version 1.0".
