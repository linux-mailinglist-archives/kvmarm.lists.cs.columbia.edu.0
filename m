Hi Gavin,

At a high-level I'm rather fearful of this series. I can see many ways
that this can break, and I can also see that even if/when we get things
into a working state, constant vigilance will be requried for any
changes to the entry code.

I'm not keen on injecting non-architectural exceptions in this way, and
I'm also not keen on how deep the PV hooks are injected currently (e.g.
in the ret_to_user path).

I see a few patches have preparator cleanup that I think would be
worthwhile regardless of this series; if you could factor those out and
send them on their own it would get that out of the way and make it
easier to review the series itself. Similarly, there's some duplication
of code from arch/x86 which I think can be factored out to virt/kvm
instead as preparatory work.

Generally, I also think that you need to spend some time on commit
messages and/or documentation to better explain the concepts and
expected usage. I had to reverse-engineer the series by reviewing it in
entirety before I had an idea as to how basic parts of it strung
together, and a more thorough conceptual explanation would make it much
easier to critique the approach rather than the individual patches.

I appreciate this is a microbenchmark, but that sounds far from
realistic.

Is there a specitic real workload that's expected to be representative
of?

Can you run tests with a real workload? For example, a kernel build
inside the VM?

So this is pure overhead in that case?

I think we need to see a real workload that this benefits. As it stands
it seems that this is a lot of complexity to game a synthetic benchmark.

Thanks,
Mark.
