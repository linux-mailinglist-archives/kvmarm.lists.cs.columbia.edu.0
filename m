Right, if we're changing the OA of a leaf PTE. If we are just adjusting
attributes on a leaf we go through stage2_attr_walker(), which skips
step 2 and does the rest in this order: 1, 4, 3.

Right. We can just skip some of the TLBI/DSB dance when making an
invalid->invalid transition.

Isn't exclusivity accomplished by checking what you get back from the
xchg()? If I get a locked PTE back, some other thread owns the PTE. If I
get anything else, then I've taken ownership of that PTE.

We only change at most a single active PTE per fault on the stage 2 MMU.
We do one of three things on that path:

 1. Install a page/block PTE to an empty PTE
 2. Replace a table PTE with a block PTE
 3. Replace a block PTE with a table PTE

1 is pretty cheap and can skip flushes altogether.

2 only requires a single TLBI (a big, painful flush of the stage 2 context),
but child PTEs needn't be flushed.

3 also requires a single TLBI, but can be done with an IPA and level
hint.

Perhaps the answer is to push teardown into the rcu callback altogether,
IOW don't mess with links in the subtree until then. At that point
there's no need for TLBIs nor atomics.
