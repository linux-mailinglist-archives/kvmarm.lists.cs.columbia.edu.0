I think we need START/STOP, start is called when migration is started and STOP
called when migration finished.

I think you mean that during the migration(between START and STOP), HA and HD
functionality is always turned on.

We need a clear during the query which mean we have to reset the dirty status 
after a query.

@kirti @yan @alex
As we know, you have worked on this feature for a long time, and it seems that
 everything is going very well now, thanks very much for your VFIO migration 
framework, it really helps a lot, and we want to start with SMMU HTTU enabled
 based on your jobs, it's kind of hardware dirty page tracking, and expected to bring us
 better performance, any suggestions? 

Thank you.
