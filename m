Ok, Thanks for your clarification about 'one giant pseudoregister'.
Lets have more discussion about the migration on next revision.
To be more clear, I plan to implement the base functionality,
where only the private event is supported. After it reaches into
mergeable or merged, we can post the add-on series to support
migration.

Ok, I think we need padding to structures of the event, to make the
event object aligned to 64-bytes aligned, and VCPU state to 512-bytes
aligned. 64-bytes and 128-bytes registers have been supported.

Thanks,
Gavin
