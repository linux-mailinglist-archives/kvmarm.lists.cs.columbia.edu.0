The only information feed by VMM is the exposed events. The events
can't be registered from guest kernel, and raised from host to guest
kernel until it's exposed by VMM. Besides, the exposed events will
be defined staticly in host/KVM as we discussed on PATCH[02/22]. We
also discussed to eliminate those ioctl commands. So I think we needn't
to add KVM_SDEI_CMD_SET_VERSION. Further more, the version is only a
concern to host itself if the migration can be done through the
firmware pseudo system registers since the migration compatibility
is the only concern to VMM (QEMU).

Yes, Currently, 0.1/0.2/1.0 versions are supported by PSCI. 0.1 is
picked until VMM asks for 0.2 and 1.0 explicitly. However, it seems
QEMU isn't using 1.0 PSCI yet and maybe more patch is needed to enable
it.

Thanks for the pointer to Raghavendra's series. The firmware pseudo
system registers have been classified into VM and VCPU scoped in the
series. I think it fits the SDEI migration requirements very well.
The shared events can even be migrated through the VM scoped firmware
pseudo system registers. However, I don't plan to support it in next
revision (v6) as currently needed events are all private. I may
spend more time to go through Raghavendra's series later.

Thanks,
Gavin
