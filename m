That was also my impression.

ERET trapping is enabled When PMBLIMITR_EL1.E = 1, PMSCR_EL1.{E0SPE,E1SPE}
= {1,0}. The first guest ERET from EL1 to EL0 enables profiling, at which
point the buffer is pinned and ERET trapping is disabled.

Guest messing with the translation tables while profiling is enabled is the
guest's problem because that's not permitted by the architecture. Any stage
2 dabt taken when the buffer is pinned would be injected back into the
guest as an SPE external abort (or something equivalent). Stage 1 dabts are
entirely the guest's problem to solve and would be injected back regardless
of the status of the buffer.

Yes, I agree, there could be a lot of ERETs from EL1 to EL1 before the ERET
to EL0; those ERETs would be uselessly trapped.

The above is a moot point anyway, because I believe we both agree that
having SPE emulation depend on FEAT_FGT is best to be avoided.

Thanks,
Alex
