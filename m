Yeah, I had the same view here, a vPE level lock might help.

Agreed!

So the first thing is that

1. there're races on choosing the RD against a concurrent LPI/vPE
affinity changing.

And sure, I will have a look on the following patch! But I'd first
talk about some other issues I've seen today...

2. Another potential race is on accessing the same RD by different
CPUs, which gets more obvious after introducing the GICv4.1.
We can as least take two registers for example:

  - GICR_VSGIR:
    Let's assume that vPE0 is just descheduled from CPU0 and then vPE1
    is scheduled on. CPU0 is writing its GICR_VSGIR with vpeid1 to serve
    vPE1's GICR_ISPENDR0 read trap, whilst userspace is getting vSGI's
    pending state of vPE0 (i.e., by a debugfs read) thus another CPU
    will try to write the same GICR_VSGIR with vpeid0... without waiting
    GICR_VSGIPENDR.Busy reads as 0.
    This is a CONSTRAINED UNPREDICTABLE behavior from the spec and at
    least one of the queries will fail.
  - GICR_INV{LPI,ALL}R:
    Multiple LPIs can be targeted to the same RD, thus multiple writes to
    the same GICR_INVLPIR (with different INITID, even with different V)
    can happen concurrently...

Above comes from the fact that the same redistributor can be accessed
(concurrently) by multiple CPUs but we don't have a mechanism to ensure
some extent of serialization. I also had a look at how KVM will handle
this kind of access, but

3. it looks like KVM makes the assumption that the per-RD MMIO region
will only be accessed by the associated VCPU?  But I think this's not
restricted by the architecture, we can do it better.  Or I've just
missed some important points here.


I will look at the following patch asap but may need some time to
think about all above, and do some fix if possible :-)
