It just occurred to me that "canonical stage 2 page table" refers to the L0
hypervisor stage 2, not to the L1 hypervisor stage 2. If you don't mind my
suggestion, perhaps the comment can be slightly improved to avoid any confusion?
Maybe something along the lines of "[..] This happens when running a non-VHE guest
hypervisor, in which case we use the canonical stage 2 page table for both vEL2
and for vEL1/0 with vHCR_EL2.VM == 0".

Thanks,
Alex
