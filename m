For the pKVM case it's up to the EL2 code to hand over suitably scrubbed 
pages to the guest, and the host doesn't have access to the pages so we 
(currently) don't have to worry about swap. If swap get implemented it 
will presumably be up to the EL2 code to package up both the normal data 
and the MTE tags into an encrypted bundle for the host to stash somewhere.

Yes, there are some ugly corner cases if we require the VMM to map with 
PROT_MTE. Hence patch 5 - an ioctl to allow the VMM to access the tags 
without having to maintain a PROT_MTE mapping.

I'm not sure if I've got my head round this one yet either, but you 
could be right there's a race. This exists without these patches:

CPU 1                    |  CPU 2
-------------------------+-----------------
set_pte_at()             |
--> mte_sync_tags()      |
--> test_and_set_bit()   |
--> mte_sync_page_tags() | set_pte_at()
    [stalls/sleeps]       | --> mte_sync_tags()
                          | --> test_and_set_bit()
                          |     [already set by CPU 1]
                          | set_pte()
                          | [sees stale tags]
    [eventually wakes up  |
     and sets tags]       |

What I'm struggling to get my head around is whether there's always a 
sufficient lock held during the call to set_pte_at() to avoid the above. 
I suspect not because the two calls could be in completely separate 
processes.

We potentially could stick a lock_page()/unlock_page() sequence in 
mte_sync_tags(). I just ran a basic test and didn't hit problems with 
that. Any thoughts?

Yes - KVM will perform the equivalent of get_user_pages() before setting 
the entry in Stage 2, that should end up performing any set_pte_at() 
calls to populate the VMM's page tables. So the VMM 'sees' the memory 
before stage 2.

The tag metadata for swapped pages lives for the same length of time as 
the swap metadata itself. The swap code already makes sure that the 
metadata hangs around as long as there are any swap PTEs in existence, 
so I think everything should be fine here. The 
arch_swap_invalidate_xxx() calls match up with the frontswap calls as it 
has the same lifetime requirements.
