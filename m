Adding Zhu, Jason, MST to the party. It all seems to be caused by this
commit:

commit a979a6aa009f3c99689432e0cdb5402a4463fb88
Author: Zhu Lingshan <lingshan.zhu@intel.com>
Date:   Fri Jul 31 14:55:33 2020 +0800

    irqbypass: do not start cons/prod when failed connect
    
    If failed to connect, there is no need to start consumer nor
    producer.

Zhu, I'd really like to understand why you think it is OK not to
restart consumer and producers when a connection has failed to be
established between the two?

In the case of KVM/arm64, this results in the guest being forever
suspended and never resumed. That's obviously not an acceptable
regression, as there is a number of benign reasons for a connect to
fail.

Thanks,

	M.
