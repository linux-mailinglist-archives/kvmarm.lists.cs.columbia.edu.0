Thank you so much for your review, Oliver!

For aarch32 guests (when KVM_ARM_VCPU_EL1_32BIT is configured),
yes, the current series is problematic as you mentioned...
I am thinking of disallowing configuring ID registers (keep ID
registers immutable) for the aarch32 guests for now at least.
(will document that)

For aarch64 guests that support EL0 aarch32, it would generally
be a userspace bug if userspace sets inconsistent values in 32bit
and 64bit ID registers. KVM doesn't provide a complete consistency
checking for ID registers, but this could be added later as needed.

It might be a good idea to skip trap configuration to avoid being
affected by the issue.  On the other hand, this might provide a
good opportunity to detect such userspace issue.  As this could
happen only with new userspace code that changes ID registers,
I might rather prefer the latter?

Thanks,
Reiji
