Regarding the last statement, that's something I had question too and
discussed with Paolo, even though at that time it's not a outcome of
discussing memory ordering issues.

IIUC the initial design was trying to avoid tlb flush flood when vcpu
number is large (each RESET per ring even for one page will need all vcpus
to flush, so O(N^2) flushing needed).  With global RESET it's O(N).  So
it's kind of a trade-off, and indeed until now I'm not sure which one is
better.  E.g., with per-ring reset, we can have locality too in userspace,
e.g. the vcpu thread might be able to recycle without holding global locks.

Regarding safety I hope I covered that below in previous reply.

The document says:

  After processing one or more entries in the ring buffer, userspace calls
  the VM ioctl KVM_RESET_DIRTY_RINGS to notify the kernel about it, so that
  the kernel will reprotect those collected GFNs.  Therefore, the ioctl
  must be called *before* reading the content of the dirty pages.

I'd say it's not an explicit promise, but I think I agree with you that at
least it's unclear on the behavior.

Since we have a global recycle mechanism, most likely the app (e.g. current
qemu impl) will use the same thread to collect/reset dirty GFNs, and
trigger the RESET ioctl().  In that case it's safe, IIUC, because no
cross-core ops.

QEMU even guarantees this by checking it (kvm_dirty_ring_reap_locked):

    if (total) {
        ret = kvm_vm_ioctl(s, KVM_RESET_DIRTY_RINGS);
        assert(ret == total);
    }

I think the assert() should never trigger as mentioned above.  But ideally
maybe it should just be a loop until cleared gfns match total.

How about adding some more documentation for KVM_RESET_DIRTY_RINGS on the
possibility of recycling partial of the pages, especially when collection
and the ioctl() aren't done from the same thread?

Any suggestions will be greatly welcomed.

Thanks,
