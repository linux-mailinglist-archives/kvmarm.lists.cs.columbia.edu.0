Sure, will go ahead and drop TraceFilt [28..31] from ID_DFR0 register.

Could you please elaborate ?

Sure, will do.

I may be missing something here but some of these fields are already there.

#define ID_ISAR5_RDM_SHIFT              24
#define ID_ISAR5_CRC32_SHIFT            16

#define ID_ISAR5_SHA1_SHIFT             8
#define ID_ISAR5_AES_SHIFT              4
#define ID_ISAR5_SEVL_SHIFT             0

static const struct arm64_ftr_bits ftr_id_isar5[] = {
        ARM64_FTR_BITS(FTR_HIDDEN, FTR_STRICT, FTR_LOWER_SAFE, ID_ISAR5_RDM_SHIFT, 4, 0),
        ARM64_FTR_BITS(FTR_HIDDEN, FTR_STRICT, FTR_LOWER_SAFE, ID_ISAR5_CRC32_SHIFT, 4, 0),

        ARM64_FTR_BITS(FTR_HIDDEN, FTR_STRICT, FTR_LOWER_SAFE, ID_ISAR5_AES_SHIFT, 4, 0),
        ARM64_FTR_BITS(FTR_HIDDEN, FTR_STRICT, FTR_LOWER_SAFE, ID_ISAR5_SEVL_SHIFT, 4, 0),

};

Sure but should we also export other fields as higher safe in there ?

Sure, will do.

Sure but should we add corresponding ID_AA64PFR2_EL1 register as well ?
