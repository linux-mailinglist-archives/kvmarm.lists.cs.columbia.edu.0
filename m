Please don't do use -next as a base. In-flight series should be based
on a *stable* tag, either 6.0 or one of the early -RCs. If there is a
known conflict with -next, do mention it in the cover letter and
provide a resolution.

This commit seems part of -rc1, so I guess the patches directly apply
on top of that tag?

I'd really like the MM folks (list now cc'd) to look at the relevant
patches (1 and 5) and ack them before I take this.

Thanks,
