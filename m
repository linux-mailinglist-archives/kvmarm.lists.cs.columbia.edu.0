It's a pleasure to review this work and it's pretty useful for
understanding how Linux works as a GICv4.1-capable hypervisor.
Yay, cheers ;-)!

I'll go through the v4.1 spec one more time before the final
review of this series, as we still have plenty of time to do
some reviews (and even some tests) before the 5.7 MW.

Good news!


Thanks,
Zenghui
