FWIW, this reasoning sounds correct to me. The DSB NSH will be
sufficient to drain the buffer, but we need the DSB ISH to ensure that
it's visbile to other CPUs at the instant we call perf_aux_output_end().

Otherwise, if CPU x is reading the ring-buffer written by CPU y, it
might see the aux buffer pointers updated before the samples are
viisble, and hence read junk from the buffer.

We can add a comment to that effect (or rework perf_aux_output_end()
somehow to handle that ordering).

Thanks,
Mark.
