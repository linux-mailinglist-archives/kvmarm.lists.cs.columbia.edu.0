Just wanted to add one more detail. vgic_v3_check_base() is also called
when creating the redistributor region (via vgic_v3_set_redist_base ->
vgic_register_redist_iodev). This patch reuses that check for the old
redist API to also check for "base + size > kvm_phys_size()" with a size
calculated using the vcpus added so far.

It's redundant for the new redist API, but still needed for the old
redist API.

It seems that GICv2 suffers from the same problem. The cpu interface
base is checked but the end can extend above IPA size. Note that the cpu
interface is 8KBs and vgic_check_ioaddr() is only checking that its base
is 4KB aligned and below IPA size. The distributor region is 4KB so
vgic_check_ioaddr() is enough in that case.

What about the following?

I can work on the next version of this patch (v2 has the GICv2 issue)
which adds vgic_check_range(), which is like vgic_check_ioaddr() but
with a size arg.  kvm_vgic_addr() can then call vgic_check_range() and
do all the checks for GICv2 and GICv3. Note that for GICv2, there's no
need to wait until first vcpu run to do the check. Also note that I will
have to keep the change in vgic_v3_check_base() to check for the old v3
redist API at first vcpu run.

Thanks,
Ricardo
