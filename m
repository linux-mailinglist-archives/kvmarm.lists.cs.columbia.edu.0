One of the design goals of kvmtool is to get away with as little emulation
as possible, in favour of paravirtualisation (so it's just virtio and not
IDE/flash). So a hardware RTC emulation sounds dispensable in this context.

I had some patches to better abstract kvm-unit-tests from QEMU, basically
by splitting up extra_params into more generic options like memsize and
command_line, then translating them.
Sounds like the time to revive them.

Fair enough, at the moment we have to trigger kvmtool tests manually
anyway. Just wanted to know what the idea is here, which I think you
answered.

Thanks,
Andre.
