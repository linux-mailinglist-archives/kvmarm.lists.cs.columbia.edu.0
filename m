Sorry, it was a silly suggestion to wedge the enum there. I don't think
it matters too much where it winds up, but something like:

  enum kvm_pgtable_owner_id {
  	OWNER_ID_PKVM_HOST,
	OWNER_ID_PKVM_HYP,
	NR_PGTABLE_OWNER_IDS,
  }

And put it somewhere that both pgtable.c and mem_protect.c can get at
it. That way bound checks (like in kvm_pgtable_stage2_set_owner())
organically work as new IDs are added.
