Sparse is already warning about this, but I had dismissed it as a false
positive.

I think this is an instance of disallowing implicit conversions of the
form

	T ** -> T const **

because this allows a const pointer to be silently de-consted, e.g.:

static const T bar;

void foo(T const **p)
{
	*p = &bar;
}

T *baz(void)
{
	T *q; 
	foo(&q);
	return q;
}


I _suspect_ that what's going on here is that the compiler is
eliminating a level of indirection during inlining (i.e. converting
pass-by-reference to direct access, which is precisely what I wanted
to happen).  This removes the potentially invalid behaviour as a
side-effect.

This relies on the compiler optimising / analysing the code
aggressively enough though.

So, I don't have a problem with dropping the extra extra const, e.g.:

static bool vq_present(
	u64 (*const vqs)[KVM_ARM64_SVE_VLS_WORDS],
	unsigned int vq)

Since this function is static and only used very locally, I don't see a
big risk: the only reason for the extra const was to check that
vq_present() doesn't modify vqs when it shouldn't.  But it's a trivial
function, and the intent is pretty clear without the extra type
modifier.


I'm in two minds about whether this is worth fixing, but if you want to
post a patch to remove the extra const (or convert vq_present() to a
macro), I'll take a look at it.

Cheers
---Dave
