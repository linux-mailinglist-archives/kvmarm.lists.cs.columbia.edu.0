Ah, I missed that.  I don't think we want to allow userspace to supply
any implementation defined values for the VM, though.

I understand that it's convenient to avoid having to write an
architecture hook, but I simply don't know if it makes sense to do this
on other architectures, and while it can be more code to have to write
the architecture hooks in QEMU, it's hardly a strong argument against
using an existing architecture-specific mechanism to inject an event to
a guest.

Note that I looked at using a an appropriate field in the kvm_run
structure, but nothing elegant came to mind.

Do you have a concrete example of how you would like to change the
kvm_run structure?

Are there other bits of the ESR than the EA that you think we should be
able to specify?

Can we decide if we need to allow userspace to provide additional
information or not, and then decide on the mechanism, instead of
conflating the two questions?

I think we should either expose the minimal mechanism to user space, or
just leave it to user space to emulate the whole thing.
