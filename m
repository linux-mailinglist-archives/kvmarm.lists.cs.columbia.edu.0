I was stating that that is an option.  I was not opining anything, I truly don't
care whether or not KVM_DEV_ARM_ITS_SAVE_TABLES is rejected.

That ship sailed when we added kvm_arch_allow_write_without_running_vcpu().
Arguably, it sailed when the dirty ring was added, which solidified the requirement
that writing guest memory "must" be done with a running vCPU.

That WARN is to catch KVM bugs.  No KVM bugs, no WARN.  WARNs must not be user
triggerable in the absence of kernel bugs.  This is a kernel rule, not a KVM thing,
e.g. see panic_on_warn.

printk() is useless for running at any kind of scale as userspace can't take action
on "failure", e.g. unless userspace has a priori knowledge of the _exact_ error
message then human intervention is required (there are other issues as well).

A ratelimited printk() makes things even worse because then a failing VM may not
get its "failure" logged, i.e. the printk() is even less actionable.

And user triggerable printks() need to be ratelimited to prevent a malicious or
broken userspace from flooding the kernel log.  Thus, this "failure" would need
to be ratelimited, making it all but useless for anyone but developers.

Yes, Marc is saying that it's not strictly wrong for userspace to not dirty log
the ITS save, so rejecting KVM_DEV_ARM_ITS_SAVE_TABLES is a bad option.
