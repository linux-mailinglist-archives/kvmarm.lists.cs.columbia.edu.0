You are right, I didn't think about this scenario. Did some digging, and
C99 explicitely states that padding is uninitialized (September 7, 2007,
draft, page 38), so I assume that it's the same for C89 (couldn't find a
free source for the standard).

To avoid this sort of thing happening in the future, KVM/arm64 could
mandate that all structs that are part of the userspace API have the
padding explicitly declared as a struct field and that padding must always
be set to zero by userspace before a syscall. KVM would then check that the
padding is zero and return -EINVAL if userspace didn't clear it correctly,
to enforce this convention. I think that should be forward compatible with
repurposing the padding to add another field, unless 0 has a special
meaning for the field that is added, which I believe to be highly unlikely.

We could add a flag to kvm_run.flags that is set only when
kvm_run.exit_reason == KVM_EXIT_DEBUG, something like
KVM_DEBUG_ARM_HSR_HIGH_SET (or PRESENT). flags has 16 bits which are unused
today, so I don't think it's too costly to use one bit for this.

One other option would be to wait to expose the upper 32 bits until KVM
supports a hardware feature that makes use of those bits. That means
advertising the feature to userspace, which KVM might or might not want to
do. And KVM today doesn't do any sanitisation/masking on the hsr value that
is reported to userspace, and tying hsr_high to a particular feature might
mean that KVM will have to sanitise the upper bits if said feature is
opt-in by userspace.

My preference is for the first approach because the second approach looks
more complicated.

There's always the option to wait until KVM makes use of the upper 32 bits
and decide then, when we have more information.

Thanks,
Alex
