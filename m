I had the assumption QEMU and kvm/selftests are the only consumers to
use DIRTY_RING. In this case, requiring that no memslots were created
to enable DIRTY_RING won't break userspace. Following your thoughts,
the tracked dirty pages in the bitmap also need to be synchronized to
the per-vcpu-ring before the bitmap can be destroyed. We don't have
per-vcpu-ring at this stage.

The helper was introduced to be shared when DIRTY_RING[_ACQ_REL] and
DIRTY_RING_WITH_BITMAP are enabled. Since the issue (2) isn't concern
to us, lets put it aside and the helper isn't needed. kvm_memslots_empty()
has same effect as to 'kvm->nr_memslot_pages', it's fine to use
kvm_memslots_empty(), which is more generic.

Agree.

The proposed changes look good to me. It will be integrated to PATCH[v8 4/9].
By the way, v8 will be posted shortly.

Thanks,
