I think I understand what you are saying - add a bare minimum emulation of the
PMMIR register now so it's less work when we do decide to support the STALL_SLOT
event for a guest.

I don't have an opinion either way. But if you do decide to add full emulation for
STALL_SLOT, I would like to help with reviewing the patches (I'm curious to see
how KVM will detect that it's running on a homogeneous system).

Thanks,
Alex
