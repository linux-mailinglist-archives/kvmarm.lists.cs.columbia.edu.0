What I meant about intercepting is on something like
arch_validate_flags() to prevent VM_SHARED and VM_MTE together but only
for mprotect(), not mmap(). However, arch_validate_flags() is currently
called on both mmap() and mprotect() paths.

We can't do much in set_pte_at() to prevent the race with only a single
bit.

Another option is to have an arch callback to force re-faulting on the
pte. That means we don't populate it back after the invalidation in the
change_protection() path. We could do this only if the new pte is tagged
and the page doesn't have PG_mte_tagged. The faulting path takes the
page lock IIUC.

Well, at least for stage 1, I haven't thought much about stage 2.

Yeah, it would have to be a custom spinning mechanism, something like:

	/* lock the page */
	while (test_and_set_bit(PG_arch_3, &page->flags))
		smp_cond_load_relaxed(&page->flags, !(VAL & PG_arch_3));
	...
	/* unlock the page */
	clear_bit(PG_arch_3, &page->flags);

Can we skip the lock if the page already has the PG_mte_tagged set?
That's assuming that we set the flag only after clearing the tags. The
normal case where mprotect() is called on a page already mapped with
PROT_MTE would not be affected.
