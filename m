I hesitated applying the reset context to the CPU before the userspace
exit because that would be wildly different from the other system
events. Userspace wouldn't have much choice but to comply with the
guest request at that point.

What about adopting the following:

 - Drop the in-kernel SYSTEM_SUSPEND emulation. I think you were
getting at this point in [1], and I'd certainly be open to it. Without
a userspace exit, I don't think there is anything meaningfully
different between this call and a WFI instruction.

 - Add data to the kvm_run structure to convey the reset state for a
SYSTEM_SUSPEND exit. There's plenty of room left in the structure for
more, and can be done generically (just an array of data) for future
expansion. We already are going to need a code change in userspace to
do this right, so may as well update its view of kvm_run along the
way.

 - Exit to userspace with PSCI_RET_INTERNAL_FAILURE queued up for the
guest. Doing so keeps the exits consistent with the other system
exits, and affords userspace the ability to deny the call when it
wants to.

I completely agree with you. The semantics are a bit funky, and I
really do wonder if the easiest way around that is to just make the
implementation a userspace problem.
