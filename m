Yes, that's what it looks like.

That'd be broken, and we wouldn't be able to support such an
implementation, at least not in configuration such as CPU isolation.

We are not allowing a vGIC without a maintenance interrupt. We are
actively mandating it. The M1 does have a working per-CPU maintenance
interrupt. It just isn't wired into an interrupt controller, which
means we can't mask it. But it is otherwise perfectly functional.

But the timer interrupt is exactly a SW emulation of a level sensitive
interrupt in this context. And the maintenance interrupt is still
required to use the vGIC.

Thanks,
