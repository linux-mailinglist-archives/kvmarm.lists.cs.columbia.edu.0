Right, sorry to be misleading.  The "atomicity" part I was trying to say
the kernel will always see consistent update on the fields.

The ordering should also be guaranteed, because things must happen with
below sequence:

  (1) kernel publish dirty GFN data (slot, offset)
  (2) kernel publish dirty GFN flag (set to DIRTY)
  (3) user sees DIRTY, collects (slots, offset)
  (4) user sets it to RESET
  (5) kernel reads RESET

So the ordering of single-entry is guaranteed in that when (5) happens it
must be after stablized (1+2).

I see what you meant...

Firstly I'm actually curious whether that'll really happen if the gfns are
collected in something like a for loop:

  for(i = 0; i < N; i++)
    collect_dirty_gfn(ring, i);

Because since all the gfps to be read will depend on variable "i", IIUC no
reordering should happen, but I'm not really sure, so more of a pure
question.

Besides, the other thing to mention is that I think it is fine the RESET
ioctl didn't recycle all the gfns got set to reset state.  Taking above
example of GFNs A-D, if when reaching the RESET ioctl only A & D's flags
are updated, the ioctl will recycle gfn A but stop at gfn B assuming B-D
are not reset.  But IMHO it's okay because it means we reset partial of the
gfns not all of them, and it's safe to do so.  It means the next ring full
event can come earlier because we recycled less, but that's functionally
safe to me.

I see.  Please let me know if above makes sense.

Thanks!
