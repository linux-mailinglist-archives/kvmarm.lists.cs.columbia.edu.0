Please do.  In the future, don't use a macro unless there's a good reason to do
so.  Don't get me wrong, I love abusing macros, but for things like this they are
completely inferior to

  static inline bool kvm_vm_has_started(struct kvm *kvm)
  {
  	return kvm->vm_started;
  }

because a helper function gives us type safety, doesn't suffer from concatenation
of tokens potentially doing weird things, is easier to extend to a multi-line
implementation, etc...

An example of when it's ok to use a macro is x86's

  #define kvm_arch_vcpu_memslots_id(vcpu) ((vcpu)->arch.hflags & HF_SMM_MASK ? 1 : 0)

which uses a macro instead of a proper function to avoid a circular dependency
due to arch/x86/include/asm/kvm_host.h being included by include/linux/kvm_host.h
and thus x86's implementation of kvm_arch_vcpu_memslots_id() coming before the
definition of struct kvm_vcpu.  But that's very much an exception and done only
because the alternatives suck more.

In your proposed patch, KVM_RUN will take kvm->lock _every_ time.  That introduces
unnecessary contention as it will serialize this bit of code if multiple vCPUs
are attempting KVM_RUN.  By checking !vm_started, only the "first" KVM_RUN for a
VM will acquire kvm->lock and thus avoid contention once the VM is up and running.
There's still a possibility that multiple vCPUs will contend for kvm->lock on their
first KVM_RUN, hence the quotes.  I called it "naive" because it's possible there's
a more elegant solution depending on the use case, e.g. a lockless approach might
work (or it might not).

I'm definitely in favor of moving/adding thing to generic KVM when it makes sense,
but I'm skeptical in this particular case.  The code _is_ arch specific in that
arm64 apparently needs to acquire kvm->lock when checking if a vCPU has run, e.g.
versus a hypothetical x86 use case that might be completely ok with a lockless
implementation.  And it's not obvious that there's a plausible, safe use case
outside of arm64, e.g. on x86, there is very, very little that is truly shared
across the entire VM/system, most things are per-thread/core/package in some way,
shape, or form.  In other words, I'm a wary of providing something like this for
x86 because odds are good that any use will be functionally incorrect.
