Well, that's a subordinate clause, not a statement.  The containing
sentence is a statement about the _implications_ of doing it, but
nothing says that it is actually done.

Often, a less condensed repeat of the subject line is enough, say,
something like the following, as a separate paragraph at the end:

	Check for RAZ visibility in the ID register accessor functions.

(Or rather, there should be a concise statement in the commit message
saying what the patch does, and the subject line should be a suitably
condensed version of _that_.)

You might want to add a simple statement of what is achieved:

	This allows the RAZ case to be handled in a generic way
	for all system registers.

That makes the intention and value of the patch easy to spot, while the
wordy paragraph is available for anyone who wants to understand the
background and rationale in more detail.

(This is just my view, but I think it's generally helpful to reviewers
to follow this rough pattern -- it makes it easy to skip non-critical
parts of the description and come back to them later on.  I might
propose edits in submitting-patches.rst to make this clearer -- and if
they are shot down in flames then I will shut up ;)

Ack.

Don't worry about this; again, I was halfway through remembering how the
code in this file worked...
