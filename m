i would s/SVE vector/streaming mode SVE vector/

is there a reason why fork() clears ZA?

i think this is a minor issue, but the usual expectation is that
on thread creation thread local state is reset in the child, but
in a forked child the state is the same as in the parent (where
ZA is preserved according to the first rule).
