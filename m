I definitely agree with the observation -- we're all trying to solve the
same set of issues. And I completely agree that a good long term goal
would be to create some common parts for all architectures. Less work
for us ARM folks it would seem ;-)

What's top of mind is how we paper over the architectural differences
between all of the architectures, especially when we need to do entirely
different things because of the arch.

For example, I whine about break-before-make a lot throughout this
series which is somewhat unique to ARM. I don't think we can do eager
page splitting on the base architecture w/o doing the TLBI for every
block. Not only that, we can't do a direct valid->valid change without
first making an invalid PTE visible to hardware. Things get even more
exciting when hardware revisions relax break-before-make requirements.

There's also significant architectural differences between KVM on x86
and KVM for ARM. Our paging code runs both in the host kernel and the
hyp/lowvisor, and does:

 - VM two dimensional paging (stage 2 MMU)
 - Hyp's own MMU (stage 1 MMU)
 - Host kernel isolation (stage 2 MMU)

each with its own quirks. The 'not exactly in the kernel' part will make
instrumentation a bit of a hassle too.

None of this is meant to disagree with you in the slightest. I firmly
agree we need to share as many parts between the architectures as
possible. I'm just trying to call out a few of the things relating to
ARM that will make this annoying so that way whoever embarks on the
adventure will see it.

All for it. I cc'ed you on the series for this exact reason, I wanted to
grab your attention to spark the conversation :)
