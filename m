I don't think this is either common nor useful. If the kernel supports
the PMU, then finding a PMU enables all the uses of the PMU, including
for guests. And userspace is still in control of what it exposes to
the guest. Yes, it's a tiny more overhead (one extra load) on the
exit/entry path. Should we care? I don't think so.

No, that's basically the only reason. That was the easy landing spot
for anything shared (including things like GIC, timers and co).
I'm not sure it is worth the move, TBH...

Yuo, and that's the reason I posted this patch. I have a couple more
that I'll post by the end of the day.

Thanks,
