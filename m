Peter, it looks like this series is blocked on the below now; what would you
prefer out of:

(a) Take this as is, and look add adding additional validation on top.

(b) Add some flag to indicate a PMU driver supports config3, and have the core
    code check that, but leave the existing fields as-is for now (and hopefully
    follow up with further validation later for the existing fields).

(c) Go audit all the existing drivers, add flags to indicate support for
    existing fields, and have the core code check that. Atop that, add support
    for config3 with the same sort of flag check.

    I suspect that'd end up needing to go check more than config1/config2 given
    all the filter controls and so on that drivers aren't great at checking,
    and that might being fairly invasive.

(d) Something else?

I think we want to get to a point where drivers indicate what they actually
support and the core code rejects stuff drivers don't support or recognise, but
I think it'd be a little unreasonable to delay this series on cleaning up all
the existing issues.

I'm tempted to say (b) as that shouldn't introduce any regressions, should be a
relatively simple change to this series, and doesn't precluse making the rest
stricter as a follow-up. I'm happy to take a look at that (and IIUC Rob is
too).

What's your preference?

Thanks,
Mark.
