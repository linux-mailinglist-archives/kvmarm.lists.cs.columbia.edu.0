Except when it doesn't work. On debian 11 I was not able to make it work for
powerpc by following the instructions, while I was able to make it work for
aarch64 following the same instructions. That's the kind of thing that I would
like to avoid.

Err.. I screwed up badly here, I just checked with ldd and lkvm was still
using the system proved libfdt.so, that's why it was still working.
Uninstalling the libfdt package broke lkvm.

I would prefer this approach, as it keeps things the Makefile simple and it
makes the build reproducible.

I wrote a patch to always link against libfdt.a, here are the results of
running make on a rockpro64 (I renamed the executables to tell which is
which).

Built from current master:

$ /usr/bin/ls -l lkvm-libfdt-dynamically-linked
-rwxr-xr-x 1 alex users 2127112 May 26 16:31 lkvm-libfdt-dynamically-linked
$ ldd lkvm-libfdt-dynamically-linked
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x0000ffffb52ae000)
	libz.so.1 => /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x0000ffffb5140000)
	libaio.so.1 => /usr/lib/libaio.so.1 (0x0000ffffb5120000)
	libfdt.so.1 => /usr/lib/libfdt.so.1 (0x0000ffffb5100000)
	libc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x0000ffffb4f50000)
	/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1 => /usr/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1 (0x0000ffffb5275000)

Built with Makefile modified to link against the static version:

$ /usr/bin/ls -l lkvm-libfdt-statically-linked
-rwxr-xr-x 1 alex users 2238920 May 26 16:32 lkvm-libfdt-statically-linked
$ ldd lkvm-libfdt-statically-linked
	linux-vdso.so.1 (0x0000ffff99a6d000)
	libz.so.1 => /usr/lib/libz.so.1 (0x0000ffff99900000)
	libaio.so.1 => /usr/lib/libaio.so.1 (0x0000ffff998e0000)
	libc.so.6 => /usr/lib/libc.so.6 (0x0000ffff99730000)
	/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1 => /usr/lib/ld-linux-aarch64.so.1 (0x0000ffff99a34000)

A difference of 109KB (111808 bytes to be more exact).

I'll send the changes to the Makefile in case people want to play with it.

Thanks,
Alex
