Good that you mention it: There is one thing we share on ARM (and 
ARM64), and that is the hypervisor enabling stub, to install our own 
vectors. If that was to be removed as well, we would have to patch it 
back downstream. So far, we only carry few EXPORT_SYMBOL patches for 
essential enabling.

That said, I was also starting to think about how long we will continue 
to support Jailhouse on 32-bit ARM. We currently have no supported SoC 
there that comes with an SMMU, and I doubt to see one still showing up. 
So, Jailhouse on ARM is really just a testing/demo case, maybe useful 
(but I didn't get concrete feedback) for cleaner collaborative AMP for 
real-time purposes, without security concerns. I assume 32-bit ARM will 
never be part of what would be proposed of Jailhouse for upstream.
