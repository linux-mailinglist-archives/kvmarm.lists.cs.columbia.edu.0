The term UNDEFINED specifically means treated as an undefined
instruction. The Glossary in ARM DDI 0487E.a says for UNDEFINED:

| Indicates cases where an attempt to execute a particular encoding bit
| pattern generates an exception, that is taken to the current Exception
| level, or to the default Exception level for taking exceptions if the
| UNDEFINED encoding was executed at EL0. This applies to:
|
| * Any encoding that is not allocated to any instruction.
|
| * Any encoding that is defined as never accessible at the current
|   Exception level.
|
| * Some cases where an enable, disable, or trap control means an
|   encoding is not accessible at the current Exception level.

So these should trigger an UNDEFINED exception rather than behaving as
RAZ/WI.

Thanks,
Mark.
