I disagree for the implications of partially trapping the 'Vendor
Specific Hypervisor Service'. If the UID for the range still reports KVM
but userspace decided to add some new widget, then from the guest
perspective that widget is now part of KVM's own ABI with the guest.

Trapping the whole range is a bit of a hack to workaround the need for
more complicated verification of a hypercall filter.

But for everything else, I'm fine with arbitrary function filtering.
Userspace is always welcome to shoot itself in the foot.

Is that hypercall in the 'Vendor Specific Hypervisor Service' range?

I'm very hopeful that by forwarding all of this to userspace we can get
out of the business of implementing every darn spec that comes along.

... assuming we know about all defined services in the kernel. I don't
care about it too much, but there is the case about a new userspace on
an old kernel.

Other hypercalls removed, would you be in favor of an all-or-nothing
rule for KVM's vendor range implementation? Of course, that could still
be enforced on whatever UAPI approach we take.
