FWIW, I've just fixed a number of issues with this series, ranging
from compilation issues when CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE is not set,
SPE setup bugs, and boot hangs when kaslr kicks in.

It all should be fixed now, and I have pushed an updated series
at [1], for those of you who really can't wait to try new stuff
while you could just ignore it all.

Thanks,

         M.
