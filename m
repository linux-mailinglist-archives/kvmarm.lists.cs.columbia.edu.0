What I was trying to say is __arm64_ftr_reg_valid() should check
if the 'bits' are the same as 'safe_bits' and should treat 'bits'
as safe if they are the same instead of calling arm64_ftr_field_valid()
as update_cpu_ftr_reg does.
In my understanding, FTR_EXACT doesn't mean only 'ftrp->safe_val'
is a safe value, but if two values are different, 'ftrp->safe_val'
is the only safe value.

I completely agree on this, and I will work on this separately from
this series as it is a different issue from what this series tries
to address.

Yes, I have been thinking the same (having a max register value for each
register rather than having a max value for each field).

Having a full set of arm64_ftr_bits in KVM I meant here is the one that
I mentioned earlier, and I am inclined to go with the option rather than
having cpufeature provide ID scheme based validation and the override
validation.  With that, KVM will still use a validation function that
cpufeture will provide, but as it is done only based on arm64_ftr_bits
provided by KVM (FTR_UNSIGNED + LOWER_SAFE entries will be generated
during KVM init, and the other entries will be statically defined in
KVM).

Compared to this separate arm64_ftr_bits option, there are two things
that I don't like a bit about the ID scheme based validation option.
One is special changes we will make in cpufeature to provide ID scheme based
validation (like for ID_AA64DFR0_EL0.PMUVER) as needed won't be used
by KVM when KVM needs another implementation (our efforts might be
wasted).  The other is (I think) it's pretty easy to forget to make
changes in cpufeature to provide ID scheme based validation for new
fields when needed.
Along with future changes to set the maximum limit for each ID register
field, I would think this separate arm64_ftr_bits option could provide
a safer way for KVM to control/maintain feature visibilities for the
guest more independently with smaller maintenance cost.

The downside of having the separate arm64_ftr_bits will be that there
are extra static arm64_ftr_bits entries that need to be defined for
FTR_SIGNED + LOWER_SAFE. It's a so big deal though because there are
just 6(?) of such entries, and I don't think we will newly have many
of such entries.

Thanks,
Reiji
