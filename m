I didn't mean so, I should probably stop mentioning x86. :)

I had some sense already from the topics in past few years of kvm forum.
Yeah I'll be looking forward to anything more coming.

The ring itself is really not the thing to blame, IMHO it's a good attempt
to try out de-coupling guest size in regard of dirty tracking from kvm.  It
may not be perfect, but it may still service some of the goals, e.g., at
least it allows the user app to detect per-vcpu information and also since
there's the ring full events we can do something more than before like the
vcpu throttling that China Telecom does with the ring structures.

But I agree it's not a generic enough solution.  Hopefully it'll still
cover some use cases so it's not completely not making sense.

Thanks,
