No, but given how few CPUs implement SPE I'd say that this configuration
is inevitable. I certainly went out of my way to support it in the driver.

It's also worth considering systems where there are multiple implementations
of SPE in play. Assuming we don't want to expose this to a guest, then the
right interface here is probably for userspace to pick one SPE
implementation and expose that to the guest. That fits with your idea above,
where you basically get an immediate exit if we try to schedule a vCPU onto
a CPU that isn't part of the SPE mask.

Not sure about userspace, but the kernel driver works by instantiating an
SPE PMU instance only for the CPUs that have it and then that instance
profiles for only those CPUs. You also need to do something similar if
you had two CPU types with SPE, since the SPE configuration is likely to be
different between them.
