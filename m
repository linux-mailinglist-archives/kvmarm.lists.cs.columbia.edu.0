I'm not saying to use the VMID directly, just that allocating half of the
pte feels a bit OTT given that the state of things after this patch series
is that we're using exactly 1 bit.

I was pondering this last night and I thought of two ways to do it:

1. Add a 'bool valid' and then stick the owner and the phys in a union.
   (yes, you'll need to update the block mapping checks to look at the
    valid flag)

2. Go with my latter suggestion:

The idea being that if owner is 0, then we install a mapping for phys, but
if owner is !0 then we set the invalid mapping.

(1) is probably the less hacky option... what do you reckon?
