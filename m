We already have sp_el0 consistency by virtue of having it stored in in
a sysreg.

To me, the whole purpose of saving some some context is to allow the
exception handling code to run C code and introspect the interrupted
state. But saving things that are not affected by the context change
seems a bit pointless.

One thing I'd like to see though is to save sp_el1 as it was at the
point of the exception (because that is meaningful to get the
exception context -- think of an unaligned EL1 stack for example),
which means correcting the value that gets saved.

So I would suggest to *only* save sp_el1, to always save it
(irrespective of the exception coming from EL0 or EL1), and to save a
retro-corrected value so that the handler can directly know where the
previous stack pointer was.

Thanks,

	M.
