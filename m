It works for me.

It's up to Marc but I think for now just make it safe and once we get
our hands on hardware, we can assess the impact. For example, starting
multiple VMs simultaneously will contend on such big lock but we have an
option to optimise it by setting PG_mte_tagged on allocation via a new
VM_* flag.

For my last suggestion above, changing the VMM ABI afterwards is a bit
tricky, so we could state now that VM_SHARED and MTE are not allowed
(though it needs a patch to enforce it). That's assuming that mprotect()
in the VMM cannot race with the user_mem_abort() on another CPU which
makes the lock necessary anyway.

Right. Can we move the sanitise_mte_tags() call to
kvm_pgtable_stage2_map() instead or we don't have the all the
information needed?
