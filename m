Hi Marc, Catalin,

I'd like to propose a new dirty tracking solution that combines hardware based
dirty tracking (DBM) and software based dirty tracking (memory abort). Hope to
get your opinions about it.

The core idea is that we do not enable hardware dirty at start (do not add DBM bit).
When a arbitrary PT occurs fault, we execute soft tracking for this PT and enable
hardware tracking for its *nearby* PTs (e.g. Add DBM bit for nearby 16PTs). Then when
sync dirty log, we have known all PTs with hardware dirty enabled, so we do not need
to scan all PTs.

We may worry that when dirty rate is over-high we still need to scan too much PTs.
We mainly concern the VM stop time. With Qemu dirty rate throttling, the dirty memory
is closing to the VM stop threshold, so there is a little PTs to scan after VM stop.

It has the advantages of hardware tracking that minimizes side effect on vCPU,
and also has the advantages of software tracking that controls vCPU dirty rate.
Moreover, software tracking helps us to scan PTs at some fixed points, which
greatly reduces scanning time. And the biggest benefit is that we can apply this
solution for dma dirty tracking.

Thanks,
Keqian
