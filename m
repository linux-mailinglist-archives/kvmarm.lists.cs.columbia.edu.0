Yeah, it can be confusing. If you have time, you could give CBMC a try
and the 'spec' would be pretty close to your C version. Each CPU would
be modelled as a thread with an extra thread that simulates the
speculative TLB look-ups for all CPUS together with the asserts for the
invariants. The spinlocks would be pthread_mutexes.

Could you call cpu_switch_kvm(0, INVALID_VMID) instead? You could do
this directly below and avoid another macro. Well, whatever you find
clearer.

What confuses me is that your INVALID_VMID looks like a valid one: vmid
0, generation 1. Do you ensure that you never allocate VMID 0?

Yes, that's what I meant.

Well, you'd have to check the TLA+ state trace and see how it got
there, whether the last state would be a valid one. It's either
something missing in the spec that the hardware enforces or the
algorithm is wrong and just hard to hit in practice. If this condition
is violated in hardware for a very brief period, e.g. due to some TLBI,
you'd not notice an issue under normal circumstances. But it's still
incorrect.

It make sense to ignore CnP for now. Maybe KVM doesn't even bother and
sets VTTBR_EL2.CnP to 0 (I haven't checked).

This was added later as part of try-to-unmap and I only checked this
with CnP =3D FALSE. I'll need to look into, it's possible that
flush_tlb_all() doesn't take into account that the pte is unmapped (as
cpu_switch_mm() does). I'll add a separate thread for speculative TLB
loads, it's easier to have them in one place. Thanks.
