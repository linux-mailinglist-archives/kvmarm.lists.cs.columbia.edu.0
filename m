Yes, I will split this patch into 3 patches in next revision at least:
[1] support page-not-present notification
[2] support page-ready notification
[3] control/configuration path support

Sure, I will improve the change log to make things more understandable.

I need to evaluate the possiblity of make guest parts common. I guess
it guess it might be hard. Currently, there are 3 architectures support
or will support the feature: x86/s390/arm64. s390 has unique implementation.
Even x86/arm64 share common implementations, but still different to some
extents. For example, x86 uses NMI/IRQ for the notifications, but arm64
uses SDEI/IRQ for them. The resources for SDEI should be pre-allocated
on arm64, but x86 doesn't have the requirement.

Yes, live-migration should be the justification in next revision. Thanks

ACPI table is needed to pass the PPI number from qemu to guest. The PPI number
is determined by qemu. The reason why we need PPI is the asynchronous page fault
notification (page-ready) is delivered on per-vCPU basis.

The 'vCPU index' was inherited from x86 implementation. Actually, the information
isn't used because the SDEI event and PPI are always sent to the target vCPU. It
means the incremental sequence number is enough to identify the associated asynchronous
page fault events. So we needn't the vCPU index conveyed as part of the token
and I will drop it in next revision.

Yeah, "in the" is missed and will be fixed if needed in next revision.

Another PPI can't be fired from host to guest before the previous PPI is
delivered and handled.

Correct. IPA can be used as token either except IPA is 64-bits
in length, but token is 32-bits long.

It's different from that one. It's the incremental sequence number associated
with asynchronous page fault events.

It's used by the guest to retrieve the supported features through
SMCCC (KVM specific feature call). Yep, it should be included in
a separate patch, as part of the prepatory work to support asynchronous
page fault for the guest.

Yes, it's the interface (or shared data struct) between host and guest.
Sorry that I don't understand your comments here. Do you mean to make
this common across multiple architectures?

Yep, the helper should be used here.

Yep, that would be better. I probably use offsetof() in next revision.

Yeah, It's a nice comment and I think @notpresent_pending and @pageready_pending
in struct kvm_vcpu_arch::apf can alternatively serve the purpose.

Ok.

I agree it will become simpler, but it's going to affect the performance greatly
if I'm understanding your comments completely. In current design, multiple works
associated with asynchronous page fault and one specific vCPU can work in the
background at same time. It seems you're suggesting to have one work is available
at once on one specific vCPU. If so, the performance will be affected greatly.

Ok. It will be moved to common part shared by x86 and arm64 in next revision.
