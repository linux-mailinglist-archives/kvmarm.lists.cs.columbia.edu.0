To be clear, the read-only page tables already have the AF set, right?
They certainly must, or else the guest isn't getting far :)

I understand you're trying to describe _why_ we promote S1PTW to
a write, but doing it inline with the context of the EFI issue makes it
slightly unclear. Could you break these ideas up into two paragraphs and
maybe spell out the fault conditions a bit more?

  A recent development on the EFI front has resulted in guests having
  their page tables baked in the firmware binary, and mapped into the
  IPA space as part of a read-only memslot. Not only is this legitimate,
  but it also results in added security, so thumbs up.

  It is possible to take an S1PTW translation fault if the S1 PTs are
  unmapped at stage-2. However, KVM unconditionally treats S1PTW as a
  write to correctly handle hardware AF/DB updates to the S1 PTs.
  Furthermore, KVM injects a data abort into the guest for S1PTW writes.
  In the aforementioned case this results in the guest taking an abort
  it won't recover from, as the S1 PTs mapping the vectors suffer from
  the same problem.

Dunno, maybe I stink at reading which is why I got confused in the first
place.

Somewhat of a tangent, but:

Aren't we somewhat unaligned with the KVM UAPI by injecting an
exception in this case? I know we've been doing it for a while, but it
flies in the face of the rules outlined in the
KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION documentation.

Besides the changelog/comment suggestions, the patch looks good to me.
