The only difference is the reset part. And I agree, it only makes the
kernel part more complicated than we strictly need it to be. It also
slightly clashes with the rest of the system events, in the sense that
it is the only one that would have an in-kernel implementation (both
reboot and power-off are entirely implemented in userspace).

So I definitely agree about dropping this.

The reset state is already available in the guest registers, which are
available to userspace. What else do we need to expose?

Yup, that's what I like about pushing this completely to userspace.

We're in violent agreement. It means that we only need the MP_STATE
part to implement WFI from userspace.

Could you try and respin this? Also, it'd be good to see a prototype
of userspace code using this, as this is a new API.

Thanks,
