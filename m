It shouldn't affect the others, the only change is that PG_arch_2 is now
only defined for arm64 but no other architecture is using it. The
problem with loongarch is that it doesn't have enough spare bits in
page->flags and even without any patches I think it's broken with the
right value for NR_CPUS.

It makes sense.
