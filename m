My bad, yes you're right. I conflated the use case here with the
architectural state.

I'm probably being way too pedantic, but I just wanted to make sure we
agree about the ensuing subtlety. More below:

I'd buy it!

I think this is where the disconnect might be. TCR_EL1.HA == 1 suggests
a write could possibly follow, but I don't think it requires it. The
page table walker must first load the S1 PTE before writing to it.

From AArch64.S1Translate() (DDI0487H.a):

    (fault, descaddress, walkstate, descriptor) = AArch64.S1Walk(fault, walkparams, va, regime,
								 ss, acctype, iswrite, ispriv);

    [...]

    new_desc = descriptor;
    if walkparams.ha == '1' && AArch64.FaultAllowsSetAccessFlag(fault) then
      // Set descriptor AF bit
      new_desc<10> = '1';

    [...]

    // Either the access flag was clear or AP<2> is set
    if new_desc != descriptor then
      if regime == Regime_EL10 && EL2Enabled() then
        s1aarch64 = TRUE;
	s2fs1walk = TRUE;
	aligned = TRUE;
	iswrite = TRUE;
	(s2fault, descupdateaddress) = AArch64.S2Translate(fault, descaddress, s1aarch64,
							   ss, s2fs1walk, AccType_ATOMICRW,
							   aligned, iswrite, ispriv);

    if s2fault.statuscode != Fault_None then
      return (s2fault, AddressDescriptor UNKNOWN);
    else
      descupdateaddress = descaddress;

    (fault, mem_desc) = AArch64.MemSwapTableDesc(fault, descriptor, new_desc,
    						 walkparams.ee, descupdateaddress)

Buried in AArch64.S1Walk() is a stage-2 walk for a read to fetch the
descriptor. The second stage-2 walk for write is conditioned on having
already fetched the stage-1 descriptor and determining the AF needs
to be set.

Relating back to UFFD: if we expect KVM to do exactly what hardware
does, UFFD should see an attempted read when the first walk fails
because of an S2 translation fault. Based on this patch, though, we'd
promote it to a write if TCR_EL1.HA == 1.

This has the additional nuance of marking the S1 PT's IPA as dirty, even
though it might not actually have been written to. Having said that,
the false positive rate should be negligible given that S1 PTs ought to
account for a small amount of guest memory.

Like I said before, I'm probably being unnecessarily pedantic :) It just
seems to me that the view we're giving userspace of S1PTW aborts isn't
exactly architectural and I want to make sure that is explicitly
intentional.
