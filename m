I tested this on a SynQuacer box as a host, using EFI firmware [0]
built from patches provided by Sami.

I booted the Debian buster installer, completed the installation, and
could boot into the system. The only glitch was the fact that the
reboot didn't work, but I suppose we are not preserving the memory the
contains the firmware image, so there is nothing to reboot into. But
just restarting kvmtool with the flash image containing the EFI
variables got me straight into GRUB and the installed OS.

Thanks again for getting this sorted.
