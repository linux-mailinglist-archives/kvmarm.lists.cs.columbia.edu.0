Although I think aligning the two algorithms makes sense, I'm not completely
sold on the need to abstract all this into a library and whether the
additional indirection is justified.

It would be great to compare this approach with one where portions of the
code are duplicated into a separate VMID allocator. Have you tried that to
see what it looks like? Doesn't need to be a proper patch set, but comparing
the end result might help to evaluate the proposal here.
