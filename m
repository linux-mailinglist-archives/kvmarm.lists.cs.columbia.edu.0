Sure. I think we could try to populate the final flag of vma in kvm_arch_prepare_memory_region().
Maybe through GUP or any better method? It's nice if you can try to solve this. :)

Right. This issue also can be solved by populating the final flag of vma in kvm_arch_prepare_memory_region().

IIUC, MMIO region is of device memory type, it's associated with device state and action.
For normal memory type, we can write it out-of-order and repeatedly, but for device memory
type, we can't do that. The write to MMIO will trigger device action based on current device
state, also what we can read from MMIO based on current device state. Thus the policy of
dirty logging for normal memory can't be applied to MMIO.

The MMIO region is a part of device state. We need extra kernel driver to support migration
of pass-through device, as how to save and restore the device state is closely related to
a specific type of device. You can refer VFIO migration for more detail.
