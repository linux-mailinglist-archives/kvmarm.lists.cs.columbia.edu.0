The rationale is that, as far as possible, we're trying to keep the EL2
code simple and agnostic of the guest and the SoC. We therefore assign
validation of the guest payload to this firmware image which is executed
when first entering the guest and made inaccessible to the host kernel
as part of the deprivilege operation during boot. The VMM could still
provide its own virtual firmware, which would then be measured by the
firmware here and chainloaded. We just deprivilege that logic from EL2
to EL1.

For pKVM on Android, it is the Android Bootloader which loads both the
host kernel and the guest firmware (which is actually just u-boot).
Before entering the host, it verifies and measures the guest firmware,
appending secrets to the reserved memory region which are later used by
the firmware to generate per-VM identities. These certificates are then
used by the guest to establish a communication channel with Android's
"Keymint" [1] HAL on the host and get access to hardware-backed key
resources. That way we have a certificate chain which ties directly into
Android Verified Boot [2] and extends to the guest payload without KVM
having to be aware of any of it.

Since this is all pretty specific to Android, delegating it to the
firmware allows others to use their own mechanisms without bloating the
privileged code at EL2 or enforcing a specific flow.

A straightforward extension in future would be to make this firmware
optional when spawning a protected VM, but since we have no need for
that in Android (where we require the firmware), we elected to keep
things minimal at first.

Cheers,

Will
