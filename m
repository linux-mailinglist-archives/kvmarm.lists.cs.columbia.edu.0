Oh, so that's the real reason for the leading underscores, I assumed that the
comment was warning enough. Since the 3 macros were right next to each other, and
__vcpu_sys_reg() is a wrapper over ctxt_sys_reg(), I thought they're there to
differentiate between returning a reference and returning a value. I'll drop this
patch and the one after it.

Thanks,

Alex
