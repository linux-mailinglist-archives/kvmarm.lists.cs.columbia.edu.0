I'd rather have it the other way around (buy-in rather than turn off).
On top of the potential issue with stupid EL3s, there is the issue that
PSCI is optional, and that protected VMs won't be able to work without
it. Another related thing is that EL3 itself is optional.

Note that this flag shouldn't be specific to PSCI proxying. It should 
also
control Stage-2 wrapping, and the whole pKVM.

Thanks,
