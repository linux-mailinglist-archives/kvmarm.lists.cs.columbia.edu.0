I'll follow up on the details of the CAP below, but wanted to explicitly
note some stuff for documentation:

Collecting the dirty bitmap should be the very last thing that the VMM
does before transmitting state to the target VMM. You'll want to make
sure that the dirty state is final and avoid missing dirty pages from
another ioctl ordered after bitmap collection.

IMO you really want the explicit buy-in from userspace, as failure to
collect the dirty bitmap will result in a dead VM on the other side of
migration. Fundamentally we're changing the ABI of
KVM_CAP_DIRTY_LOG_RING[_ACQ_REL].
