Should we document which parts of instruction-emulation the VMM has to do?

For KVM_EXIT_MMIO, kvm looks after updating registers and advancing the PC and SS state
machine.

I can't see a kvm_skip_instr() in here, so the VMM has to do all of that stuff, including
any register post-increment, which is the reason we need the instruction in the first place.


Thanks,

James
