No worries. I've had this patch for a few weeks now, and can't
make up my mind about it. It does address an actual issue though,
so I couldn't just discard it... ;-)

What I mean is that the cache invalidation should take place,
preferably without involving KVM at all (other than populating
S2 if required).

Not quite. What I *think* we should do is:

- DC CIVAC should just work, without going to userspace. I can't imagine
   a reason why we'd involve userspace for this, and we currently don't
   really have a good way to describe this to userspace.

- DC IVAC is more nuanced: we could either inject an exception (which
   is what this patch does), or perform the CMO ourselves as a DC CIVAC
   (consistent with the IVA->CIVA upgrade caused by having a S2 
translation).
   This second approach is comparable to what we do when the guest
   issues a CMO on an emulated MMIO address (we don't inject a fault).

Thanks,

         M.
