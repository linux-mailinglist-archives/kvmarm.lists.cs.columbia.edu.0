There's also the protected KVM case which IIUC wouldn't provide any
mapping of the guest memory to the host (or maybe the host still thinks
it's there but cannot access it without a Stage 2 fault). At least in
this case it wouldn't swap pages out and it would be the responsibility
of the EL2 code to clear the tags when giving pages to the guest
(user_mem_abort() must not touch the page).

So basically we either have a valid, accessible mapping in the VMM and
we can handle the tags via set_pte_at() or we leave it to whatever is
running at EL2 in the pKVM case.

I don't remember whether we had a clear conclusion in the past: have we
ruled out requiring the VMM to map the guest memory with PROT_MTE
entirely? IIRC a potential problem was the VMM using MTE itself and
having to disable it when accessing the guest memory.

Another potential issue (I haven't got my head around it yet) is a race
in mte_sync_tags() as we now defer the PG_mte_tagged bit setting until
after the tags had been restored. Can we have the same page mapped by
two ptes, each attempting to restore it from swap and one gets it first
and starts modifying it? Given that we set the actual pte after setting
PG_mte_tagged, it's probably alright but I think we miss some barriers.

Also, if a page is not a swap one, we currently clear the tags if mapped
as pte_tagged() (prior to this patch). We'd need something similar when
mapping it in the guest so that we don't leak tags but to avoid any page
ending up with PG_mte_tagged, I think you moved the tag clearing to
user_mem_abort() in the KVM code. I presume set_pte_at() in the VMM
would be called first and then set in Stage 2.

When is the page metadata removed? I want to make sure we don't drop it
for some pte attributes.
