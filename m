I'll add a comment.

Very good point! I should have thought about that. I think splitting the
test_and_set_bit() in two (as with the cache flush) is sufficient. While
there technically still is a race which could lead to user space tags
being clobbered:

a) It's very odd for a VMM to be doing an mprotect() after the fact to
add PROT_MTE, or to be sharing the memory with another process which
sets PROT_MTE.

b) The window for the race is incredibly small and the VMM (generally)
needs to be robust against the guest changing tags anyway.

But I'll add a comment here as well:

	/*
	 * There is a potential race between sanitising the
	 * flags here and user space using mprotect() to add
	 * PROT_MTE to access the tags, however by splitting
	 * the test/set the only risk is user space tags
	 * being overwritten by the mte_clear_page_tags() call.
	 */

Thanks,

Steve
