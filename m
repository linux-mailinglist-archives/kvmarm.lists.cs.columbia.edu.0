(seems like you figured some of this out in a later reply).

Hmm, that's an interesting one. If we ever want to adjust KVM_PGTABLE_MAX_LEVELS
things will break, so we just need to take that into account should future
architecture extensions add an extra level. I suppose I can add a comment
to that effect and use ARM64_HW_PGTABLE_LEVEL_SHIFT() instead.

Thanks!

Yes, although this is slightly more idiomatic due to its use of
DIV_ROUND_UP imo. But happy to replace it.

Yeah, this is fiddly. kvm_start_level() doesn't cater for concatenation at
all and it's only used to determine the start level for the hypervisor
stage-1 table. For the stage-2 page-tables, we actually extract the start
level back out of the vtcr, as that gets configured separately and so we
just parameterise ourselves around that.

I think I'll remove kvm_start_level() entirely, and just inlined it into
its single call site (which will be neater using ARM64_HW_PGTABLE_LEVELS).

This is ok, as we basically process the PGD one page at a time so that the
details of concatenation only really need to be exposed to the iterator.
See the use of kvm_pgd_page_idx() in _kvm_pgtable_walk().

It is allowed, but in that case we don't revisit the block entry, as there's
really no need. Compare that with installing a table, where you may well
want to descend into the new table to initialise the new entries in there.

The kerneldoc for kvm_pgtable_walk() talks a bit about this. (aside: that
function isn't actually used, but it felt useful to expose it as an
interface).

Thanks for the review,

Will
