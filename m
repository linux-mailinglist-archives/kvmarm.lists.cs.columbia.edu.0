Which is why I said 'maybe'. It's not a big deal if the flags stays,
but I don't want it evaluated further down the line. It is also pretty
similar to HCR_EL2.RW, which we already test with vcpu_el1_is_32bit().

Overall, we need to reduce that state to be as simple as possible.

2 bits is what I had in mind (one bit to indicate that it has already
been initialised, another to carry the actual width).

Thanks,
