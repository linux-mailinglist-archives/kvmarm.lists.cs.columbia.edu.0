All allocations that are tied to specific VM/vCPU are tagged GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT,
so we should be good on that front.

It was mostly an honest question, I too am trying to understand what userspace
wants to do with this information.  I was/am also trying to understand the benefits
of doing the tracking through page_state and not a dedicated KVM stat.  E.g. KVM
already has specific stats for the number of leaf pages mapped into a VM, why not
do the same for non-leaf pages?
