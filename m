The memory synchronization in the IPI sender functions make perfect sense, that's
how IPIs are used - one CPU kicks the target, the target reads from a shared
memory location.

I don't think receiving an interrupt from a device is how one would usually expect
to do inter-processor communication. However, I did more digging about this
ability to trigger interrupts from made-up devices, and it seems to me that this
was introduced for testing purposes (please correct me if I'm wrong). With this in
mind, I guess it wouldn't be awkward to have the wmb() in its_send_int(), because
we are using it just like we would an IPI. And it also reduces the boilerplate code.

I'll make the change in the next iteration.

Thanks,
Alex
