Hi Cornelia,

The intent is that the mte-alloc property may be set on memory whose
allocation tag storage is not directly accessible via physical memory,
since in this case there is no need for the hypervisor to do anything
to protect allocation tag storage before exposing MTE to guests. In
the case of QEMU + KVM, I would expect the emulated system to not
expose the allocation tag storage directly, in which case it would be
able to set mte-alloc on all memory nodes without further action,
exactly as my patch implements for TCG. With the interface as
proposed, QEMU would need to reject the mte-shared-alloc option when
KVM is enabled, as there is currently no mechanism for KVM-accelerated
virtualized tag storage.

Note that these properties are only relevant for guest kernels running
under an emulated EL2 in which pKVM could conceivably run, which means
that the host would need to implement FEAT_NV2. As far as I know there
is currently no support for NV2 neither in QEMU TCG nor in the Linux
kernel, and I'm unaware of any available hardware that supports both
NV2 and MTE, so it'll be a while before any of this becomes relevant.

Peter
