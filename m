I'll add a patch to re-mask it so this intent is clear, and the behaviour/performance
stuff is done in separate patches.

Retested with isb in both patches, and Robin's better assembly.

This still saves the self-synchronising pstate modification, (of which we'd need two if we
want to keep SError masked over the rest of world-switch)
