I think taht should be opt-in, yes.

I understood that host time wouldn't change here, but what was not clear
is which notion of host time is being exposed to the guest.

e.g. is that a raw monotonic clock, or one subject to periodic adjument,
or wall time in the host? What is the epoch of the host time?

That would be great; thanks!
