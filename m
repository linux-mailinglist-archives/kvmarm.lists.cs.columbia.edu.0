Yup! To the point where I can't trust the function names and have to look
at what the code does...

I think we're aligned here. To me this code is becoming very fragile, difficult
for me to make sense of and is stretching the abstractions we've made. This is
why it is difficult to enhance it without breaking something. It's why I felt it
was safer to add 'an extra check' in the SWINCR than to risk touching something
that I didn't have the confidence I could be sure was correct.
