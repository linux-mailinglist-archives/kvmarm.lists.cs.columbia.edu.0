No, not for ZONE_DEVICE.

However, if you expose PMEM via dax/kmem as System RAM to the system (-> 
add_memory_driver_managed()), then PMEM (managed via ZONE_NOMRAL or 
ZONE_MOVABLE) would work with pfn_to_online_page() -- as the system 
thinks it's "ordinary system RAM" and the memory is managed by the buddy.
