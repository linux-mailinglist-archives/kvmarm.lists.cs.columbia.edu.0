I believe that above, you are reducing the period by the amount period_left
would have been - they cancel each other out.

Given that kvm_pmu_perf_overflow is now always called between a
cpu_pmu->pmu.stop and a cpu_pmu->pmu.start, it means armpmu_event_update
has been called prior to this function, and armpmu_event_set_period will
be called after...

Therefore, I think the above could be reduced to:

+	/*
+	 * Reset the sample period to the architectural limit,
+	 * i.e. the point where the counter overflows.
+	 */
+	u64 period = GENMASK(63, 0);
+	if (!kvm_pmu_idx_is_64bit(vcpu, pmc->idx))
+		period = GENMASK(31, 0);
+
+	pmc->perf_event->attr.sample_period = period;
+	pmc->perf_event->hw.sample_period = period;

This is because armpmu_event_set_period takes into account the overflow
and the counter wrapping via the "if (unlikely(left <= 0)) {" block.

Though this code confuses me easily, so I may be talking rubbish.

I'm not sure that this flag, or patch 4 is really needed. As the perf
events created by KVM are pinned to the task and exclude_(host,hv) are set -
I think the perf event is not active at this point. Therefore if you change
the sample period, you can wait until the perf event gets scheduled back in
(when you return to the guest) where it's call to pmu.start will result in
armpmu_event_set_period being called. In other words the pmu.start and
pmu.stop you add in patch 4 is effectively being done for you by perf when
the KVM task is switched out.

I'd be interested to see if the following works:

+	WARN_ON(pmc->perf_event->state == PERF_EVENT_STATE_ACTIVE)
+
+	/*
+	 * Reset the sample period to the architectural limit,
+	 * i.e. the point where the counter overflows.
+	 */
+	u64 period = GENMASK(63, 0);
+	if (!kvm_pmu_idx_is_64bit(vcpu, pmc->idx))
+		period = GENMASK(31, 0);
+
+	pmc->perf_event->attr.sample_period = period;
+	pmc->perf_event->hw.sample_period = period;

What about ARM 32 bit support for this?

Thanks,
