That seems like a very narrow use case. If you actually pin vcpus to
physical CPU classes, DT is the right place to put things, because
it is completely static. This is effectively creating a virtual
big-little, which is in my opinion a userspace job.

Anything that is a one-off belongs to firmware configuration, IMO.

The case I'm concerned with is when vcpus are allowed to roam across
the system, and hit random physical CPUs because the host has no idea
of the workload the guest deals with (specially as the AMU counters
are either absent or unusable on any available core).

The cost of a hypercall really depends on where you terminate it.
If it is a shallow exit, that's only a few hundred cycles on any half
baked CPU. Go all the way to userspace, and the host scheduler is the
limit. But the frequency of that hypercall obviously matters too.

How often do you expect the capacity request to fire? Probably not
on each and every time slice, right?

Quentin, can you shed some light on this?

Thanks,

         M.
