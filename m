Wouldn't that mean that --target-efi is equally confusing? Do you have
suggestions for other names?

Setting the VMM at configure time was initially added to remove a warning
from lib/arm/io.c, where if the UART address if different than what
kvm-unit-tests expects the test would print:

WARNING: early print support may not work. Found uart at 0x1000000, but early base is 0x9000000.

kvmtool emulates a different UART, at a different address than what qemu
emulates, and kvm-unit-tests compares the address found in the DTB with the
qemu UART's address (the address is used to be a #define lib/arm/io.c, now
it's generated at configure time in lib/config.h).

On top of that, configuring kvm-unit-tests to run under kvmtool will also
set CONFIG_ERRATA_FORCE to 1. At the time when kvmtool support was added,
kvmtool didn't have support for running a test with an initrd from which to
extract erratas. This has been recently fixed in kvmtool, now it can run a
test with an initrd.

Thanks,
Alex
