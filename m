Good point.

One possible implementation of suspend could just be a `WFI` in a
higher EL. In this case, KVM could emulate WFI wake up events
according to D1.16.2 in DDI 0487G.a. But I agree, it isn't entirely
clear what constitutes a wakeup from powered down state.

I think this could be handled, so long as we allow userspace to
indicate it has woken a vCPU. Depending on this, in the next KVM_RUN
we'd say:

- Some IMP DEF event occurred; I'm waking this CPU now
- I've either chosen to ignore the guest or will defer to KVM's
suspend implementation

No expert on this, I'll need to do a bit more reading to give a good
answer here.

Right. I implemented this from the mindset that userspace may do
something heavyweight when a guest suspends, like save it to a
persistent store to resume later on. No matter what we do in KVM, I
think it's probably best to give userspace the right of first refusal
to handle the suspension.

I believe it is largely up to the caller to get devices in a quiesced
state appropriate for a system suspend, but PSCI is delightfully vague
on this topic. On the contrary, it is up to KVM's implementation to
guarantee caches are clean when servicing the guest request.

I'll crank on this a bit more and see if I have more thoughts.
