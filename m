Ah, I was definitely missing this context. Current behavior makes much
more sense then.

Isn't that a tad bit different though? I'll admit, I'm just as guilty
with my own series forgetting to add a KVM_CAP (oops), but it is in my
queue to kick out with the fix for nVHE/ptimer. Nonetheless, if a user
takes up a new KVM UAPI, it is up to the user to run on a new kernel.

My concerns are explicitly with the 'under the nose' changes, where
KVM modifies the guest feature set without userspace opting in. Based
on your comment, though, it would appear that other parts of KVM are
affected too. It doesn't have to be rollback safety, either. There may
simply be a hypercall which an operator doesn't want to give its
guests, and it needs a way to tell KVM to hide it.

Oh, agreed on the nastiness. Lazy hack to realize the intended
functional change..

This seems more reasonable, especially since we do this for migrating
the guest's PSCI version.

Alternatively, I had thought about using a VM attribute, given the
fact that it is non-architectural information and we avoid ABI issues
in KVM_GET_REG_LIST without buy-in through a KVM_CAP.
