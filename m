The series can be found at [1], and the Linux patches that this series is
based on at [2].

The series adds support for the KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_PMU PMU attribute,
which allows userspace to set a PMU for a VCPU. This PMU is used by KVM
when creating perf events to emulate the guest PMU.

Without settings this attribute, the PMU used when creating events is the
first one that successfully probed when booting, but this is unreliable as
the probe order can change (if the order of the PMUs is changed in the DTB
or if asynchronous driver probing is enabled at the host's command line),
and furthermore it requires the user to have intimate knowledge of how the
PMU was chosen in order to pin the VM on the correct physical CPUs.

With KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_PMU, the user is still expected to pin the VM
on a particular set of CPUs, but now it can be any CPUs as long as they
share the same PMU. The set does not depend anymore on the driver probe
order and all that is necessary for the user to know is which CPUs are the
little core and which are the big cores, in a big.little configuration,
which I believe is more reasonable.

Patches #1-#5 move the PMU code to aarch64, where it belongs, because the
PMU has never been supported on KVM for arm. This also paves the way for
pulling in the KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_PMU attribute, which was not defined
for KVM for arm (when KVM supported arm). This can be merged right now,
independently of the other patches.

Patches #6-#7 add the function cpulist_parse(), copied almost as-is from
Linux v5.15.

Patch #8 pulls all the necessary user API definitions, and finally patch #9
adds support for KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_PMU.
