The operation of set/clear mm_cpumask was removed in arm64 compared to
arm32. It seems no side effect on current arm64 system, but from
software meaning it's wrong.
I think we should keep mm_cpumask just like arm32.

Sorry for the mistake quote, what I mean is what is done in arm32:
clear all bits of mm->cpu_mask in new_context(), and set back one by
one. Here is my patch:

C-SKY SMP is only one hart per core, but here is a patch [1] with my
thought on SMT duplicate tlb flush:
[1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-csky/1561305869-18872-1-git-send-email-guoren@kernel.org/T/#u

For TLA+ model, I still need some learning before I could talk with you.

I think it's one fo the cases that other archs also could get benefit
from arm's asid allocator code.
Btw, Is this detected by arm's aisd allocator TLA+ model ? Or a real
bug report ?
