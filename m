Hi James,

Thanks for this fix

Reviewed-by: Andrew Jones <drjones@redhat.com>

but, going forward, I think we need a more robust solution to CPU feature
additions in order to avoid these types of issues. Our current approach is
to patch KVM to hide features from the guest as we introduce support to
the [guest] kernel. IOW, we have to remember to maintain a guest CPU
feature reject-list. And, since that's error-prone, we should do regular
audits of the reject-list to ensure it's complete. It would be better to
have an accept-list (all features masked by default) and then only expose
features as we add the KVM support. Maybe we should introduce KVM masks
for each ID register? Also, regarding the current implementation, do you
know if a recent audit has been conducted to ensure (now with MPAM) that
the current feature hiding is complete?

Thanks,
drew
