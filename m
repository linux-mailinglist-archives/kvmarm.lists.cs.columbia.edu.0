That was intentional; there I was only providing rationale for how to
review the patch...

... as also commented here.

I can drop the reference from the commit message, if that's confusing?

very good spot, and that's a much better reference. 

I had mistakenly assumed SPAN took effect when 0b1, since it wasn't
called nSPAN, and page D5-2578 doesn't mention the polarity of the bit:

| When ARMv8.1-PAN is implemented, the SCTLR_EL1.SPAN and SCTLR_EL2.SPAN
| bits are used to control whether the PAN bit is set on an exception to
| EL1 or EL2. 

I've updated this to be:

|	// PSTATE.PAN is unchanged unless SCTLR_ELx.SPAN == 0b0
|	// SCTLR_ELx.SPAN is RES1 when ARMv8.1-PAN is not implemented
|	// See ARM DDI 0487E.a, page D13-3264.
|	new |= (old & PSR_PAN_BIT);
|	if (!(sctlr & SCTLR_EL1_SPAN))
|		new |= PSR_PAN_BIT;

Thanks for confirming this!

I did something like that initially, but the comments got very verbose,
and so I moved to doc + page/section numbers alone.

The section numbers and headings also vary between revisions of the ARM
ARM, so I'd prefer to leave this as-is for now. I think it's always
going to be necessary to look at the referenced version of the ARM ARM
(in addition to a subsequent revision when updating things).

Thanks,
Mark
