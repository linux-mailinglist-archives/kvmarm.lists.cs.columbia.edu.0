Had a look at struct kvm_cpu_context and indeed the only field which doesn't
represent a guest register is __hyp_running_vcpu. Did a grep for all the places
where __hyp_running_vcpu is used, and indeed the assumption is that for a guest
the pointer is NULL, as __sysreg_restore_el1_state() relies on it.

Checked that code earlier in the function does not touch the guest registers from
vcpu->arch.ctxt, to make sure we're not overwriting other reset values by mistake.
Looks good to me:
