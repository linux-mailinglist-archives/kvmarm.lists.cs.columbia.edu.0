One tweak: rather that use @NULL as a magic param, #define VM_MODE_DEFAULT to
point at a global struct, similar to what is already done for __aarch64__.

E.g.

	__vm_create(VM_MODE_DEFAULT, nr_runnable_vcpus, 0);

does a much better job of self-documenting its behavior than this:

	__vm_create(NULL, nr_runnable_vcpus, 0);

I was hoping to avoid forcing tests to build a struct, but looking at all the
existing users, they either use for_each_guest_mode() or just pass VM_MODE_DEFAULT,
so in practice it's a complete non-issue.

The page fault usage will likely be similar, e.g. programatically generate the set
of combinations to test.

So yeah, let's try the struct approach.
