Funny. My wife says otherwise... ;-)

Yeah, decent machines are hard to find :-(. Some TV boxes ship with 4GB,
but that'd be a waste a time (and money). If the Windows-ARM laptops
allowed to run EL2 code, they'd be great... I guess you're going to be
stuck with your cloud machine for a long while.

One possibility would be trap accesses to a special page (magic 
device?),
but that requires cooperation from the OS kernel as well. There is 
hardly
anything else that would guarantee a trap directly from EL0 to EL2 (EL1
can always get in the way).
