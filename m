Not saying we necessarily should, but this is possible with FGT no?

Doesn't pinning the buffer also imply pinning the stage 1 tables
responsible for its translation as well? I agree that pinning the buffer
is likely the best way forward as pinning the whole of guest memory is
entirely impractical.

I'm also a bit confused on how we would manage to un-pin memory on the
way out with this. The guest is free to muck with the stage 1 and could
cause the SPU to spew a bunch of stage 2 aborts if it wanted to be
annoying. One way to tackle it would be to only allow a single
root-to-target walk to be pinned by a vCPU at a time. Any time a new
stage 2 abort comes from the SPU, we un-pin the old walk and pin the new
one instead.

Live migration also throws a wrench in this. IOW, there are still potential
sources of blackout unattributable to guest manipulation of the SPU.

Going to think on this some more..
