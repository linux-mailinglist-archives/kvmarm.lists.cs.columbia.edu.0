Having been previously tangled up in the confusion mentioned by Quentin, I'm
also strongly in favour of leaving the terminology as-is for the time being.
Once we have some of the more interesting memory transitions (i.e.
approaching the cross-product of host/guest/hyp/trustzone doing
share/unshare/donate) then I think we'll be in a much better position to
improve the naming, but whatever we change now is very unlikely to stick and
the patches as we have them now are at least consistent.

I replied separately on the first patch, as I don't really have a strong
opinion on that one.
