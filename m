Add the documentation for the bitmap firmware registers in
hypercalls.rst and api.rst. This includes the details for
KVM_REG_ARM_STD_BMAP, KVM_REG_ARM_STD_HYP_BMAP, and
KVM_REG_ARM_VENDOR_HYP_BMAP registers.

Since the document is growing to carry other hypercall related
information, make necessary adjustments to present the document
in a generic sense, rather than being PSCI focused.

+Bitmap Feature Firmware Registers
+---------------------------------
+
+Contrary to the above registers, the following registers exposes the hypercall
+services in the form of a feature-bitmap to the userspace. This bitmap is
+translated to the services that are available to the guest. There is a register
+defined per service call owner and can be accessed via GET/SET_ONE_REG interface.
+
+By default, these registers are set with the upper limit of the features that
+are supported. This way userspace can discover all the electable hypercall services
+via GET_ONE_REG. The user-space can write-back the desired bitmap back via
+SET_ONE_REG. The features for the registers that are untouched, probably because
+userspace isn't aware of them, will be exposed as is to the guest.
+
+Note that KVM would't allow the userspace to configure the registers anymore once
+any of the vCPUs has run at least once. Instead, it will return a -EBUSY.
+
+The psuedo-firmware bitmap register are as follows:
+
+* KVM_REG_ARM_STD_BMAP:
+    Controls the bitmap of the ARM Standard Secure Service Calls.
+
+  The following bits are accepted:
+
+    Bit-0: KVM_REG_ARM_STD_BIT_TRNG_V1_0:
+      The bit represents the services offered under v1.0 of ARM True Random
+      Number Generator (TRNG) specification, ARM DEN0098.
+
+* KVM_REG_ARM_STD_HYP_BMAP:
+    Controls the bitmap of the ARM Standard Hypervisor Service Calls.
+
+  The following bits are accepted:
+
+    Bit-0: KVM_REG_ARM_STD_HYP_BIT_PV_TIME:
+      The bit represents the Paravirtualized Time service as represented by
+      ARM DEN0057A.

+    Bit-0: KVM_REG_ARM_VENDOR_HYP_BIT_FUNC_FEAT
