Right. I guess this system supports WA1 and reports "not affected".

What if kernel 5.11 adds unconditional support for a feature and that
results in a new sysreg gets exposed? How do you plan to restore this
guest on 5.10?

In may work in limited cases, but it doesn't in general. To make that
work, you'd need to implement some explicit buy-in from userspace on
each and every feature that gets added to the hypervisor. This is
completely impractical, and I have no desire to support it.
