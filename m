Currently KVM assume everything is an asynchronous-external-abort as that was the pre-RAS
behaviour. SError interrupt means something along the lines of 'part of the SoC fell out',
and I expect we're not going to get very far before we trip over the problem again.
If we don't, its probably something related to the guest.

With v8.2 we can tell these things apart, so we could try harder, but I don't think
anything uses SError-Interrupt. Its much more likely that catastrophic errors are taken to
EL3 firmware, or handled by a dedicated microcontroller.

I guess whether its a problem depends on how much work we're going to do. It doesn't feel
right to carry on once we know something is burning.

If its a bug to make an HVC from SError-masked code, this would only happen if IESB
synchronised the error.

For __kvm_vcpu_run_*(), we could return immediately as if we'd taken an IRQ out of the
guest, this is pretty much the trick __guest_enter pulls. We should probably do this today.

For others, we could rewind ELR_EL2 and forcibly emulate the exception back into the host.
If it returns, it runs the HVC again. Its probably not worth the effort, unless we do the
same for the guest.... which won't promise not to do this from masked

What we don't know can't hurt us! I think this is fine provided we don't end up making the
blackout window huge. A whole set of extra vectors is I guess the cost of this.


Will KVM ever want to handle its own errors? (it doesn't today).

If its okay to merge KVM's asynchronous external abort and the hosts, then I agree this
works, we'd need to be careful not to unmask SError or run ESB.

If KVM wants to know if its an asynchronous external abort that it caused, you'd need to
virtualise the errors for the host.

Sounds fun.

Other than trapping things from the host, I'm confused as to the circumstances that
DISR_EL1 would get clobbered. (is there an example?)

Isn't that unnecessary in the "EL2 would continue as usual except it won't
consume any SErrors with the ESB." world?


DISR_EL1 belongs to the thing that is consuming SError for the platform. The hardware
takes care of ensuring the guest can never corrupt this. KVMs EL2 code is part of the
host, so it magically knows its not overwriting anything when uses the ESB-instruction.
I can see how trapping stuff from the host would change that.

Save restoring it looks really weird, having two things consuming errors leads to problems
around who consumes what. Not handling the DISR_EL1 value as quickly as possible looks
problematic.

(I don't think I'm answering the question here).


For trapping, or KVM detecting its own asynchronous-external-abort, I think you need to
turn the virtualisation on. Otherwise its avoiding ESB-instructions and unmasking SError,
which comes with the cost of special copies of things like the vectors.


Thanks,

James
