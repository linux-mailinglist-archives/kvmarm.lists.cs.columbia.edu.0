Hey folks,

I have some lingering thoughts on this subject since we last spoke and
wanted to discuss.

I'm having a hard time figuring out how a VMM should handle a new
hypercall identity register introduced on a newer kernel. In order to
maintain guest ABI, the VMM would need to know about that register and
zero it when restoring an older guest.

Perhaps instead we could reserve a range of firmware registers as the
'hypercall identity' registers. Implement all of them as RAZ/WI by
default, encouraging userspace to zero these registers away for older
VMs but still allowing an old userspace to pick up new KVM features.
Doing so would align the hypercall identity registers with the feature
ID registers from the architecture.

Thoughts?

Oliver
