Using generically sounding NOMAP ("don't create direct mapping") to 
identify device regions feels like a hack. I know, it was introduced 
just for that purpose.

Looking at memblock_mark_nomap(), we consider "device regions"

1) ACPI tables

2) VIDEO_TYPE_EFI memory

3) some device-tree regions in of/fdt.c


IIUC, right now we end up creating a memmap for this NOMAP memory, but 
hide it away in pfn_valid(). This patch set at least fixes that.

Assuming these pages are never mapped to user space via the struct page 
(which better be the case), we could further use a new pagetype to mark 
these pages in a special way, such that we can identify them directly 
via pfn_to_page().

Then, we could mostly avoid having to query memblock at runtime to 
figure out that this is special memory. This would obviously be an 
extension to this series. Just a thought.
