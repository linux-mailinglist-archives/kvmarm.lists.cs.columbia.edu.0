It has a release however and kvm_device_release also removes the
device from the list that would then be cleared by kvm_destroy_devices.

kvm_device_release is a release callback for the file operations so it
'might' be called in all paths.

Fun though, in kvm_ioctl_create_device the error handling for
the anon_inode_getfd calls ops->destroy without checking it exists.
Boom.

Possibly never happens in reality but looks like a bug to me.
