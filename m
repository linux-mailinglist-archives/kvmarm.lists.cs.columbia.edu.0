Maintaining strong adherence to the architecture is equally important,
and I'm sure we can find anecdotes to support how not doing the
expected, can also lead to disastrous outcomes.

Have you had a look at the suggested patch I sent?  The idea is that we
can preserve existing legacy ABI, allow for a better debugging
experience, allow userspace to do emulation if it so wishes, and provide
a better error message if userspace doesn't handle this properly.

One thing we could change from my proposed patch would be to have KVM
inject the access as an external abort if the target address also
doesn't hit an MMIO device, which is by far the common scenario reported
here on the list.

Hopefully, a mission critical deployment based on KVM/Arm (scary as that
sounds), would use a recent and patched VMM (QEMU) that either causes
the external abort, or reboots the VM, as per the configuration of the
particular system in question.


Thanks,

    Christoffer
