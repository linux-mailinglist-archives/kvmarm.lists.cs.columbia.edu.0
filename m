My main concern with treating S2 faults as a synthetic external abort is
how this behavior progresses in later versions of the architecture.
SPEv1p3 disallows implementations from reporting external aborts via the
SPU, instead allowing only for an SError to be delivered to the core.

I caught up with Will on this for a little bit:

Instead of an external abort, how about reporting an IMP DEF buffer
management event to the guest? At least for the Linux driver it should
have the same effect of killing the session but the VM will stay
running. This way there's no architectural requirement to promote to an
SError.
