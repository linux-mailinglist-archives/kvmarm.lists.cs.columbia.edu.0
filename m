I believe it's not feasible to do everything as a result of a SPE stage 2
fault. I've explained where in this reply [1]. Sorry for fragmenting the
discussion into so many different threads.

Having the first write, and only that first write, trigger a stage 2 fault
that KVM handles by pinning the buffer works because the guest hasn't
written anything useful to the buffer.

What are you thinking when you are saying "one way or another"? Because
that would need changes to KVM (mlock() is not enough).
