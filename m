Many thanks for taking a look. My bad!. The 'sched_out' would indeed run in=
 parallel
and defeat the purpose. I must say I was really confused by the TLA+ syntax=
 and
is still not very confident about it.

Based on the above suggestion, I have modified it as below,

\* vCPU is scheduled out by KVM
macro vcpu_sched_out() {
        active_kvm[self].task :=3D 0;
        active_vmids[self] :=3D INVALID_VMID;
}
....

\* About to run a Guest VM
process (sched \in CPUS)
{
sched_loop:
        while (TRUE) {
                with (t \in TASKS) {
                        if (t # ActiveTask(self))
                                call kvm_arm_vmid_update(t);
                        else
                                vcpu_sched_out();
                }
        }
}

Please let me know if this is ok.

Ok. I will take a look at that and try that.

 The corresponding

Yes, I understand that it is a strong requirement. Also, I thought this is =
something
that will trigger easily with the test setup I had with the real hardware. =
But testing
stayed on for days, so I was not sure it is a problem with the TLA+ impleme=
ntation
or not.  =

I removed CnP related Invariants to simplify things for the first version. =
Also not sure
what specific changes we need to do for CnP here. Do we still need that swi=
tching to =

global pg_dir to prevent any speculative reading? I didn't see that being d=
one in KVM =

anywhere at the moment. Maybe I am missing something.

On a side note, In my setup, the CnP=3DTRUE case for asidalloc.tla now fail=
s with,
"Error: Invariant TLBEmptyInvalPTE is violated.". Please check.

Thanks,
Shameer =
