It isn't a requirement and the drivers needn't follow strictly. I checked
several drivers before looking into the patch and found almost all the
drivers have VM_PFNMAP set at mmap() time. In drivers/vfio/vfio-pci.c,
there is a comment as below, but it doesn't reveal too much about why
we can't set VM_PFNMAP at fault time.

static int vfio_pci_mmap(void *device_data, struct vm_area_struct *vma)
{
       :
         /*
          * See remap_pfn_range(), called from vfio_pci_fault() but we can't
          * change vm_flags within the fault handler.  Set them now.
          */
         vma->vm_flags |= VM_IO | VM_PFNMAP | VM_DONTEXPAND | VM_DONTDUMP;
         vma->vm_ops = &vfio_pci_mmap_ops;

         return 0;
}

To set these flags in advance does have advantages. For example, VM_DONTEXPAND
prevents the vma to be merged with another one. VM_DONTDUMP make this vma
isn't eligible for coredump. Otherwise, the address space, which is associated
with the vma is accessed and unnecessary page faults are triggered on coredump.
VM_IO and VM_PFNMAP avoids to walk the page frames associated with the vma since
we don't have valid PFN in the mapping.

Yeah, Santosh's email isn't reachable. I think the VM_PFNMAP need to be
rechecked after gup if we're going to support this case.

Thanks,
