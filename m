Well, we already call into C functions with KASLR, and nothing explodes
with that, so I must be doing something else wrong.

I do have cache maintenance for the writes to the shadow registers, so 
that
part should be fine. But I think I'm missing some cache maintenance 
around
the FDT base itself, and I wonder what happens when we go around the 
loop.

I'll chase this down now.

Thanks for the heads up.
