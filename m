ESR_EL1.EA doesn't mean "this is an external abort". It means
"given that this is an external abort as indicated by ESR_EL1.DFSC,
specify the external abort type". Traditionally this is 0 for
an AXI bus Decode error ("interconnect says there's nothing there")
and 1 for a Slave error ("there's something there but it told us
to go away"), though architecturally it's specified as impdef
because not everybody uses AXI. In QEMU we track the difference
between these two things and for TCG will raise external aborts
with the correct EA bit value.

In QEMU, use of a generic API would look something like
this in kvm-all.c:

        case KVM_EXIT_MMIO:
            DPRINTF("handle_mmio\n");
            /* Called outside BQL */
            MemTxResult res;

            res = address_space_rw(&address_space_memory,
                                   run->mmio.phys_addr, attrs,
                                   run->mmio.data,
                                   run->mmio.len,
                                   run->mmio.is_write);
            if (res != MEMTX_OK) {
                /* tell the kernel the access failed, eg
                 * by updating the kvm_run struct to say so
                 */
            } else {
                /* access passed, we have updated the kvm_run
                 * struct's mmio subfield, proceed as usual
                 */
            }
            ret = 0;
            break;

[this is exactly the current QEMU code except that today
we throw away the 'res' that tells us if the transaction
succeeded because we have no way to report it to KVM and
effectively always RAZ/WI the access.]

This is nice because you don't need anything here that has to do
"bail out to architecture specific handling of anything",
you just say "nope, the access failed", and let the kernel handle
that however the CPU would handle it. It just immediately works
for all architectures on the userspace side (assuming the kernel
defaults to not actually trying to report an abort to the guest
if nobody's implemented that on the kernel side, which is exactly
what happens today where there's no way to report the error for
any architecture).
The downside is that you lose the ability to be more specific about
architecture-specific fine distinctions like decode errors vs slave
errors, though.

Or you could have an arm-specific API that does care about
fine details like the EA bit (and maybe also other ESR_ELx
fields); that has the downside that userspace needs to
make the handling of error returns from "handle this MMIO
access" architecture specific, but you get architecture-specific
benefits as a result. (Preferably the architecture-specific
APIs should at least be basically the same, eg same ioctl
or same bit of the kvm_run struct being updated with some parts
being arch-specific data, rather than 3 different mechanisms.)

Having an API that is architecture specific but doesn't actually
let you define any of the architecture-specific aspects of
what the abort might imply seems like the worst of both worlds.
If all we can say is "this aborted" then we might as well have
the API be generic.

thanks
