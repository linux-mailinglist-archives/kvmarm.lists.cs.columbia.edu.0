[Reposting this, as it has been almost two weeks since the initial
 announcement and we're still at sub-10% of the users having
 subscribed to the new list]
 
Hi all,

As you probably all know, the kvmarm mailing has been hosted on
Columbia's machines for as long as the project existed (over 13
years). After all this time, the university has decided to retire the
list infrastructure and asked us to find a new hosting.

A new mailing list has been created on lists.linux.dev[1], and I'm
kindly asking everyone interested in following the KVM/arm64
developments to start subscribing to it (and start posting your
patches there). I hope that people will move over to it quickly enough
that we can soon give Columbia the green light to turn their systems
off.

Note that the new list will only get archived automatically once we
fully switch over, but I'll make sure we fill any gap and not lose any
message. In the meantime, please Cc both lists.

I would like to thank Columbia University for their long lasting
support and willingness to help during this transition, as well as
Konstantin (and the kernel.org crew) for quickly stepping up to the
challenge and giving us a new home!

Thanks,

	M.
