Yeah, this reads a bit strange, but there is some reason around it (I
think!)

As it applies to ID registers, REG_RAZ already implies RAZ w/ immutable
writes (-EINVAL if something different is written). As such I didn't want
to change the meaning of the other ID registers to WI and only ignore
writes for the registers that could have an UNKNOWN value. Furthermore,
I added the _USER_ tag to make it clear that we aren't magically allowing
writes from the guest to these registers.

I think we will need an additional visibility bit (or special accessor,
which I tried to avoid) to precisely apply WI to the 32bit registers,
but if the _USER_ tag is distracting I can get rid of it. After all,
hardware should politely UNDEF the guest when writing to such a
register.

Thoughts?
