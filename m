Following your suggestion I added a dsh ish at the end of loop and
before disabling pmcr_el0 (I hope this is the place you were thinking
of) but unfortunately it does not seem to fix my issue.

yeah I saw that, hence my question about the reasonable disparity we can
expect from the HW/SW stack.

In our case there seems to be a huge discrepancy.

I agree with you on the fact a reasonable margin must be observed and
the tests may need to be rewritten to account for the observed disparity
if considered "normal". Another way to proceed is to compute the
disparity before launching the main tests and if too big, skip the main
tests. Again on some HW, the counts are really 'as expected' and constant.

Thanks!
