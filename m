I've CC'ed a few more arch-specific kvm lists for
comments/concerns/suggestions on the idea (feel free to add any other
relevant groups/persons). Based on the response, I can start an
independent RFC series for the same.

Got it. I'll arrange that in the next spin.

Thanks. This is great. I can steal a couple of bits and implement the
flags introduced in the series here.
