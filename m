Hi,

This is an attempt to revive this series originally posted by
Julien Grall[1]. The main motive to work on this now is because
of the requirement to have Pinned KVM VMIDs and the RFC discussion
for the same basically suggested[2] to have a common/better vmid
allocator for KVM which this series provides.
 
Major Changes from v3:

-Changes related to Pinned ASID support.
-Changes to take care KPTI related bits reservation.
-Dropped support for 32 bit KVM.
-Rebase to 5.12-rc7

Individual patches have change history for any major changes
from v3.

Tests were performed on a HiSilicon D06 platform and so far not observed
any regressions.

For ASID allocation,

Avg of 10 runs(hackbench -s 512 -l 200 -g 300 -f 25 -P),
5.12-rc7: Time:18.8119
5.12-rc7+v4: Time: 18.459

~1.8% improvement.

For KVM VMID,

The measurement was made with maxcpus set to 8 and with the
number of VMID limited to 4-bit. The test involves running
concurrently 40 guests with 2 vCPUs. Each guest will then
execute hackbench 5 times before exiting.

The performance difference between the current algo and the
new one are(ag. of 10 runs):
    - 1.9% less exit from the guest
    - 0.7% faster

For complete series, please see,
 https://github.com/hisilicon/kernel-dev/tree/private-v5.12-rc7-asid-v4

Please take a look and let me know your feedback.

Thanks,
Shameer

From V3:

Hi all,

This patch series is moving out the ASID allocator in a separate file in order
to re-use it for the VMID. The benefits are:
    - CPUs are not forced to exit on a roll-over.
    - Context invalidation is now per-CPU rather than
      broadcasted.

There are no performance regression on the fastpath for ASID allocation.
Actually on the hackbench measurement (300 hackbench) it was .7% faster.

The measurement was made on a Seattle based SoC (8 CPUs), with the
number of VMID limited to 4-bit. The test involves running concurrently 40
guests with 2 vCPUs. Each guest will then execute hackbench 5 times
before exiting.

The performance difference (on 5.1-rc1) between the current algo and the
new one are:
    - 2.5% less exit from the guest
    - 22.4% more flush, although they are now local rather than broadcasted
    - 0.11% faster (just for the record)

The ASID allocator rework to make it generic has been divided in multiple
patches to make the review easier.

A branch with the patch based on 5.3-rc1 can be found:

http://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=people/julieng/linux-arm.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/heads/vmid-rework/v3

For all the changes see in each patch.
