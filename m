I'm perfectly happy for the early functions to call this, or for us to
add something new firmwware_get_random_*() functions that we can call
early (and potentially at runtime, but less often than
arch_get_random_*()).

I suspect the easy thing to do for now is plumb this into the existing
early arch functions and hwrng.

Thanks,
Mark.
