Ok got it. Basically we kick the target_vcpu because there is a change
in its IRQ input signal that has to be signalled (by updating the
HCR_EL2.VI that in turns updates the ISR_EL1.I). I read the comment as
if we don't care about the target_vcpu.hcr_el2 update and was struggling
to understand the whole code path.

Back to reading the code (properly :)).

Thanks,
Lorenzo
