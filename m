I'll admit I definitely drilled down on the fact that KVM is the only
actual user of these, and not the fact that it was realigning the fields
with the Arm ARM :)

Ah right. __arm64_ftr_reg_valid() needs to trust either the value that
comes from the boot CPU, or ->safe_val if the cores are different in the
system. And what does it mean if the caller specified FTR_EXACT?

I'll think on this more if I have any other suggestions.

Urgh. Ignore me, I fixated to heavily on the SAFE_VAL you used for
DEBUGVER, not the fact that it was LOWER_SAFE.

Sounds good. Per your suggestion above, changing the
naming/documentation around what is being added to cpufeature removes
the confusion that it relates to KVM and really is a precise
implementation of the rules in the Arm ARM.

Currently KVM implements a sparsely-defined denylist on top of whatever
we get back from read_sanitised_ftr_reg(). We do not have an absolute
upper bound for all fields in the feature registers, so there are times
where unsupported features leak through to the guest much like the SPE
commit I mentioned below.

What I am suggesting is that KVM define an absolute limit on what it
virtualizes for *all* fields, including what is presently RAZ. We have
absolutely no idea whether or not we can virtualize new features that
come in later revisions of the spec. It does mean we will need to
raise those limits from time to time, but would rather do that than
accidentally expose a feature we cannot virtualize.

We cannot require userspace to write to these registers to run a guest
given the fact that the present ABI doesn't. Given that fact, KVM is
still responsible for having sane default values for these registers.

If a field that we do not handle implies a feature we do not virtualize
on newer hardware, invariably our guest will see it and likely panic
when it realizes the vCPU is out of spec.

Maybe the feature bits tables is a bit extreme given the fact that it
does define the architected handling of each field. I think the upper
bound on register values I mentioned above would do the trick and avoid
copy/pasting a whole set of structures we don't desperately need.

arm64_ftr_bits might be a bit extreme in KVM after all, I'll retract
that suggestion in favor of what I said above :)

Thanks for being patient working through all of this with me.
