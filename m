I won't try to argue that this is the right fix, as I haven't fully
grasped how all this code works, but, afaict, this is how it worked
prior to bee038a6.

Marc, I've tested this and it resolves the issue for me. If/when you post
it you can add a t-b from me if you like.

Isn't kvm_arm_timer_set_reg() only for userspace setting of the register?
In this test case I don't think userspace is involved at that point.
