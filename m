Thanks for the explanation. I understand the term 'lazy route' now. Right,
cap->flags is good place to hold #defines in future. cap->args[0] doesn't
suite strictly here.

Agreed that it's cheap to reserve cap->flags. I will change the code accordingly
in v10.

Sure. I would give v9 a few days, prior to posting v10. I'm not sure if other people
still have concerns. If there are more comments, I want to address all of them
in v10 :)

Thanks,
