Yes, my concern is that VMM can be confused if it sees something 
different from what the guest on the vCPU sees.

By "ioctl", I meant the value the VMM gets for the vCPU thread. The 
problem is that the guest on the vCPU and the VMM issuing ioctl on the 
same thread can see different values, and it doesn't seem quite right.

Yes, I meant MIDR_EL1.

I meant that the values exposed to the VMM via ioctls does not seem 
useful. They still need to be exposed to the guest as you say.
