By "early allocator" I mean here an allocator that can be used with the MMU
off.

The "desirable or feasible" part refers to the fact that the page allocator
cannot be used an early allocator (when the MMU is off) because 1. It
doesn't do the necessary cache maintenance operations and 2. It would be
hard to do add them, as the internal structures that the page allocator
maintains are significantly more complex than what the physical allocator
uses.

With this part: "together with the lock removal, the physical allocator
becomes more appealing as a very early allocator [..]" I was trying to say
that the physical allocator has now become as simple as it can possibly be
(well, align_min could also be removed and leave it up to the calling code
to request correctly aligned allocations but it's debatable if users of the
allocator should know about how it's implemented). I can reword or remove
this part if you feel it's confusing.

Thanks,
Alex
