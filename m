Hi Kalesh,

Sorry for the radiosilence.

I see that in v7 you've dropped the stacktrace bits for now; I'm just
commenting here fot future reference.

I'm fine with the concept of splitting the unwind and logging steps; this is
akin to doing:

	stack_trace_save_tsk(...);
	...
	stack_trace_print(...);

... and I'm fine with having a stack_trace_save_hyp(...) variant.

However, I would like to ensure that we're reusing logic rather than
duplicating it wholesale. There are some changes I would like to make to the
stacktrace code in the near future that might make that a bit easier, e.g.
reworking the stack transition checks to be table-driven, and factoring out the
way we handle return trampolines.

I'll Cc you on changes to the stacktrace code. There are some preparatory
cleanups I'd like to get out of the way first which I'll send shortly.

Thanks,
Mark.
