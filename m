The system of choice to see this is an Apple M1 box. Not supported in
mainline yet, but things are progressing pretty quickly.

Well, that's part of the problem. Currently, you don't get a message,
and the guest faults on its first memory access forever (level 0
translation fault), as the VTCR_EL2.T0SZ value is bogus.

I can change this patch to reject 40bit IPA when requested as a
default with something saying "Userspace using unsupported default IPA
limit, upgrade your VMM".

Now, there is another nit[1] which I just found with my kvmtool setup
that computes the optimal IPA space for a given VM. And that one is
even more problematic...

Thanks,

	M.
