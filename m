I didn't look into dtc's code and not sure if dtc has this sort of validation.
Besides, dtc is out of scope when QEMU is involved. The device-tree blob isn't
produced by dtc in QEMU.

Yes, it's valid from the kernel's perspective. The default distance
matrix, where the local and remote distances are 10 and 20, is applied
if the distance map is missed in device-tree. The code can be found from
drivers/base/arch_numa.c::numa_alloc_distance()

Besides, it's possible that the distance map isn't populated by QEMU.
However, I'm going to improve the situation so the distance map will
be populated unconditionally.

The following option is supported by QEMU, to specify the distance
between two NUMA nodes. However, it's not mandatory. The distance
map in device-tree won't be populated if the option is missed.

     -numa dist,a=<src_numa_node>,b=<dst_numa_node>,val=<distance>

Thanks,
Gavin
