No, it does handle both exception and PC increment, unless I have
completely bodged something (entirely possible).

No, you are missing this (subtle) comment in kvm_host.h:

<quote>
/*
 * Overlaps with KVM_ARM64_EXCEPT_MASK on purpose so that it can't be
 * set together with an exception...
 */
#define KVM_ARM64_INCREMENT_PC		(1 << 9) /* Increment PC */
</quote>

So (KVM_ARM64_PENDING_EXCEPTION | KVM_ARM64_EXCEPT_MASK) checks for
*both* an exception and a PC increment.

Thanks,
