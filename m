No, this is likely a bug in your L1 guest, which was fixed in -rc3:

2a5f1b67ec57 ("KVM: arm64: Don't access PMCR_EL0 when no PMU is 
available")

and was found in the exact same circumstances. Alternatively, and if
you don't want to change your L1 guest, you can just pass the --pmu
option to kvmtool when starting the L1 guest.

Hope this helps,

         M.
