The signal handling code requires that register data be provided to
restore with either form of SVE data, this falls out of the existing
requirement that register data be provided for SVE.

In both cases it's mirroring the expected PCS which is that for normal
functions they must be called with streaming mode disabled, the high
bits of Z may be changed and there is a lazy saving scheme for ZA.  The
handling of the Z registers falls out of a combination of the fact that
the low bits are shared with the V registers and a desire to
interoperate with binaries that are only aware of FPSIMD.

See:

  https://github.com/rsandifo-arm/abi-aa/blob/sme-aapcs64/aapcs64/aapcs64.rst

for the PCS (it's an open pull request on the AAPCS), if we disable ZA
we should really cooperate with the lazy save scheme for ZA in section
6.5 which would involve writing to userspace buffers.  Given that we
need to support preserving ZA for cases where userspace is preempted
it's not really much effort to do that, if userspace doesn't want the
cost it can disable ZA before doing a syscall and it means that syscalls
don't push userspace code that would otherwise not do anything with ZA
to have problems interoperating with the lazy saving scheme.

If we don't preserve ZA then userspace will be forced to save it when
enabled which increases overall costs, if we do preserve ZA then it's no
more expensive for the kernel to save it than userspace, we avoid the
cost of restoring in the case where return directly to userspace without
context switching and if we do future work to save more lazily then we
may be able to avoid some of the saves.

Yes, we will exit streaming mode and proceed as per sve.rst and the rest
of the ABI.

Largely just because it's more complicated to implement copying the ZA
backing store for this and it seemed more likely that someone would be
surprised by a new process getting stuck carrying a potentially large
copy of ZA around that it was unaware of than that someone would
actually want that to happen.  It's not a particularly strongly held
opinon.

We don't referenced it, it's just carried over from SVE.
