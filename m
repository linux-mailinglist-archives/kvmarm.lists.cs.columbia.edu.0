I'm sorry, but no, this isn't acceptable. Userspace is concerned with
finding out about the dirty pages, and nothing else. The method by
which you exposes which pages are dirty is not the business of
userspace *at all*.

If you limit the IPIs to the CPUs running the VM, they you are already
in a situation where you effectively stop the guest to parse the S2
page tables.

Well, you'd have to have another set of PT to map the S2
linearly. Yes, it consumes memory.

But you are still reading the leaf entries of the PTs, hence defeating
any sort of prefetch that the CPU could do for you. And my claim is
that reading the bitmap is much faster than parsing the PTs. Are you
saying that this isn't the case?

I don't see why you would rely on stopping DMA if you can track all
the dirty pages in a unified way (SMMU + CPU sharing a single log). It
doesn't matter anyway, since such HW doesn't exist, and won't exist
for the foreseeable future.

As for the S2 DBM, I still remain unconvinced. My take still is that
without a good story for tracking DMA, this only makes the S2 MMU code
more complex, without any concrete benefit. Without DMA, what we have
today is adequate, and doesn't require exposing yet another userspace
interface.

If you solve the DMA issue, I'll be more than happy to reconsider.

Thanks,

	M.
