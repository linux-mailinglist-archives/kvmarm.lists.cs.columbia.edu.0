There is no misunderstanding at all. Your patch is broken in several ways
as I explained in detail.

So just by chance I scrolled further down and found more replies from
you. Please trim the reply properly and add your 'Thanks Jianyong' to the
end of the mail.

Again. While it is consistent in terms of storage, it's still wrong to
expose a pointer to something which has no life time guarantee. Even if
your use case is just to compare the pointer it's a bad idea to do that
especially without any comment about the pointer validity at all.

Thanks,
