Since these are within the "vendor specific" SMCCC region ideally you should also check that you are talking to KVM. (Other hypervisors could allocate SMCCC IDs differently within this block). Will has a patch on a branch which gives an example of how this could work [1]

PV_LOCK_PREEMPTED also needs to return the address of this data structure. Either by returning this in another register, or by e.g. treating a positive return as an address and a negative value as an error.

I think it would be worth mentioning in this document that the structure is guaranteed to be 64-byte aligned.
