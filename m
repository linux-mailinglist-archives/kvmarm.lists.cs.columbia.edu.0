I didn't find anything claiming it was the standard way of doing it. I
also considered using 'NOTE', but I was afraid it wouldn't stand out
as a "problem" enough. And, even though 'BUG' would certainly stand out,
I felt it implied we should be posting a fix.

Anyway, I'd be happy to change it to whatever the consensus is.

Thanks,
