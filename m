Currently there's nothing stopping processes sharing tags (mmap(...,
PROT_MTE, MAP_SHARED)) - I agree making use of this is tricky and it
would have been nice if this had just been prevented from the beginning.

Given the above, clearly the lock can't be per mm and robust.

I'm not entirely clear whether you mean "can only reliably work" to be
"is practically impossible to coordinate tag values", or whether you are
proposing to (purposefully) introduce the race with a per-mm lock? (and
document it).

I guess we could have a per-mm lock and handle the race if user space
screws up with the outcome being lost tags (double clear).

But it feels to me like it could come back to bite in the future since
VM_SHARED|VM_MTE will almost always work and I fear someone will start
using it since it's permitted by the kernel.
