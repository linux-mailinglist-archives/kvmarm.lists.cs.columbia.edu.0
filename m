Yep, it's much clearer to describe it as vCPU thread and migration worker.

Yes, it's good idea. I will have something like below in next revision :)

     In rseq_test, there are two threads, which are vCPU thread and migration
     worker separately. Unfortunately, the test has the wrong PID passed to
     sched_setaffinity() in the migration worker. It forces migration on the
     migration worker because zeroed PID represents the calling thread, which
     is the migration worker itself. It means the vCPU thread is never enforced
     to migration and it can migrate at any time, which eventually leads to
     failure as the following logs show.
         :
         :
     Fix the issue by passing correct parameter, TID of the vCPU thread, to
     sched_setaffinity() in the migration worker.

Ok. I've been having my style for long time. Actually, the style was
shared by some one when I worked for IBM long time ago. I will bear
it in mind to use imperative expression since now on :)

All your comments will be fixed in next revision, but I would delay
the posting a bit to see Sean or Paolo have more comments. In that
case, I can fix all of them at once.

Thanks again for your time on this.
