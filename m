Thanks, this is a nice implementation of the concept.  I'll check s390 
before the next merge window, as I intend to merge this and the SEV 
tests (which I have already confirmed to work; I haven't yet checked 
SEV-ES because it's a bit harder for me to install new kernels on the 
SEV-ES machine I have access to).
