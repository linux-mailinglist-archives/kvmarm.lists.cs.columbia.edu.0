PMBSR_EL1.DL might be set 1 as a result of stage 2 fault reported by SPE,
which means the last record written is incomplete. Records have a variable
size, so it's impossible for KVM to revert to the end of the last known
good record without parsing the buffer (references here [1]). And even if
KVM would know the size of a record, there's this bit in the Arm ARM which
worries me (ARM DDI 0487H.a, page D10-5177):

"The architecture does not require that a sample record is written
sequentially by the SPU, only that:
[..]
- On a Profiling Buffer management interrupt, PMBSR_EL1.DL indicates
  whether PMBPTR_EL1 points to the first byte after the last complete
  sample record."

So there might be gaps in the buffer, meaning that the entire buffer would
have to be discarded if DL is set as a result of a stage 2 fault.

Also, I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but SPE reports the guest VA in
PMBPTR_EL1 (not the IPA) on a fault, so KVM would have to walk the guest's
stage 1 tables to service the faults, which would add to the overhead of
servicing the fault. Don't know if that makes a difference, just thought I
should mention it as another peculiarity of SPE.
