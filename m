I think in the general case we don't even need VM_SHARED. For example,
we have two processes mapping a file, read-only. An mprotect() call in
both processes will race on the page->flags via the corresponding
set_pte_at(). I think an mprotect() with a page fault in different
processes can also race.

The PROT_EXEC case can be easily fixed, as you said already. The
PROT_MTE with MAP_PRIVATE I think can be made safe by a similar
approach: test flag, clear tags, set flag. A subsequent write would
trigger a CoW, so different page anyway.

Anyway, I don't think ptep_modify_prot_start/end would buy us much, it
probably makes the code even harder to read.

That's bogus: lock_page() might sleep but this whole code sequence is
under the ptl spinlock. There are some lock_page_* variants but that
would involve either a busy loop on this path or some bailing out,
waiting for a release.

Options:

1. Change the mte_sync_tags() code path to set the flag after clearing
   and avoid reading stale tags. We document that mprotect() on
   MAP_SHARED may lead to tag loss. Maybe we can intercept this in the
   arch code and return an error.

2. Figure out some other locking in the core code. However, if
   mprotect() in one process can race with a handle_pte_fault() in
   another, on the same shared mapping, it's not trivial.
   filemap_map_pages() would take the page lock before calling
   do_set_pte(), so mprotect() would need the same page lock.

3. Use another PG_arch_3 bit as a lock to spin on in the arch code (i.e.
   set it around the other PG_arch_* bit setting).

I ran out of ideas.
