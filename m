This series adds support for using the Arm Memory Tagging Extensions
(MTE) in a KVM guest.

Changes since v11[1]:

 * Series is prefixed with a bug fix for a potential race synchronising
   tags. This is basically race as was recently[2] fixed for
   PG_dcache_clean where the update of the page flag cannot be done
   atomically with the work that flag represents.

   For the PG_dcache_clean case the problem is easier because extra
   cache maintenance isn't a problem, but here restoring the tags twice
   could cause data loss.

   The current solution is a global spinlock for mte_sync_page_tags().
   If we hit scalability problems that other solutions such as
   potentially using another page flag as a lock will need to be
   investigated.

 * The second patch is from Catalin to mitigate the performance impact
   of the first - by handling the page zeroing case explicitly we can
   avoid entering mte_sync_page_tags() at all in most cases. Peter
   Collingbourne has a patch which similarly improves this case using
   the DC GZVA instruction. So this patch may be dropped in favour of
   Peter's, however Catalin's is likely easier to backport.

 * Use pte_access_permitted() in set_pte_at() to identify pages which
   may be accessed by the user rather than open-coding a check for
   PTE_USER. Also add a comment documenting what's going on.
   There's also some short-cuts added in mte_sync_tags() compared to the
   previous post, to again mitigate the performance impact of the first
   patch.

 * Move the code to sanitise tags out of user_mem_abort() into its own
   function. Also call this new function from kvm_set_spte_gfn() as that
   path was missing the sanitising.

   Originally I was going to move the code all the way down to
   kvm_pgtable_stage2_map(). Sadly as that also part of the EL2
   hypervisor this breaks nVHE as the code needs to perform actions in
   the host.

 * Drop the union in struct kvm_vcpu_events - it served no purpose and
   was confusing.

 * Update CAP number (again) and other minor conflict resolutions.
