Wow. It's amazing it did anything sensible!

That's what I was expecting indeed. The registers are identified
differently to make my life easier (and at some point I considered
writing a compat interface before making up my mind and canning the
thing altogether).

You may have to end-up with a static binary, which is not very
appealing...
