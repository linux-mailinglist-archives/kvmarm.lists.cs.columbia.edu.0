By "normal" I think both Steven and I meant the Normal Cacheable memory
attribute (another being the Device memory attribute).

I agree.

Does pfn_to_online_page() returns a valid struct page pointer for
ZONE_DEVICE pages? IIUC, these are not guaranteed to be system RAM, for
some definition of system RAM (I assume NVDIMM != system RAM). For
example, pmem_attach_disk() calls devm_memremap_pages() and this would
use the Normal Cacheable memory attribute without necessarily being
system RAM.

So if pfn_valid() is not equivalent to system RAM, we have a potential
issue with MTE. Even if "system RAM" includes NVDIMMs, we still have
this issue and we may need a new term to describe MTE-safe memory. In
the kernel we assume MTE-safe all pages that can be mapped as
MAP_ANONYMOUS and I don't think these include ZONE_DEVICE pages.

Thanks.
