Yes, with this patchset we still support !VHE system with built-in KVM. 
While for VHE system we could support kernel module and check at module 
init to avoid wrong usage of kvm module on !VHE systems.

Making KVM as a kernel module has many advantages both for development 
and real use environment. For example, we can backport and update KVM 
codes independently and don't need to recompile kernel. Also making KVM 
as a kernel module is a basic for kvm hot upgrade feature without 
shutdown VMs and hosts. This is very important for Cloud Service 
Provider to provides non-stop services for its customers.

Thanks,
