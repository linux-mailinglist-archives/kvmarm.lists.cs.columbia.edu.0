While we do hardcode zero as the guest physical base address, we don't
require tests to use DEFAULT_GUEST_PHY_PAGES for slot0. They only get
that if they use vm_create_default* to create the vm. While trying to
keep the framework flexible for the unit tests does lead to complexity,
I think the ucall mmio address really needs to be something that can move.
It's not part of the test setup, i.e. whatever the unit test wants to
test, it's just part of the framework. It needs to stay out of the way.

You're right that we can't improve things by adding ucall_init to
vm_create though, even if we added my suggestion of changing ucall_init
to be an unmap-old, map-new type of thing, since we'd still always need
the deferred ucall_init call to be sure we got it right.

We could replace the mmio address search with a hardcoded default address
though, probably the start address of the search (most likely that's the
one that's always used). Then, if there's a problem with that address,
an explicit ucall_init with its optional argument would need to be
provided in the unit test, along with a comment explaining why it's
there to ensure nobody removes it.

Thanks,
drew
