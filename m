Currently we have memmap entries with struct page set to defaults for the
NOMAP memory. AFAIU hiding them in pfn_valid()/pfn_valid_within() was a
solution to failures in pfn walkers that presumed that for a pfn_valid()
there will be a struct page that really reflects the state of that page.

Not sure we really need a new pagetype here, PG_Reserved seems to be quite
enough to say "don't touch this".  I generally agree that we could make
PG_Reserved a PageType and then have several sub-types for reserved memory.
This definitely will add clarity but I'm not sure that this justifies
amount of churn and effort required to audit uses of PageResrved().

Stop pushing memblock out of kernel! ;-)

Now, seriously, we can minimize memblock involvement in run-time and this
series in yet another step in that direction.
