Thank you both for the suggestions.

About to send v5 with the suggested changes, with a slight modification.
V5 adds "struct kvm_vm_mem_params" which includes a "guest mode" field.
The suggestion was to overload "guest mode". What I have doesn't change
the meaning of "guest mode", and just keeps everything dealing with
"guest mode" the same (like guest_mode.c).

The main changes are:

1. adding a struct kvm_vm_mem_params that defines the memory layout:

	-struct kvm_vm *____vm_create(enum vm_guest_mode mode, uint64_t nr_pages);
	+struct kvm_vm *____vm_create(struct kvm_vm_mem_params *mem_params);

2. adding memslot vm->memslot.[code|pt|data] and change all allocators
to use the right memslot, e.g.,: lib/elf should use the code memslot.

3. change the new page_fault_test.c setup_memslot() accordingly (much
nicer).

Let me know what you think.

Thanks!
Ricardo
