I don't think so, it's the implementation's choice. In general I don't
think devices will have a retry limit, but it doesn't seem like the PCI
spec prevents them from implementing one either. It could be useful to
stop retrying after a certain number of faults, for preventing livelocks
when the OS doesn't fix up the page tables and the device would just
repeat the fault indefinitely.

We do give an invalid response for the old PRG (because of unregistering),
but also for the new one, which has a different address that the guest
might be able to page in and would normally return success.

Yes I think the damage would always be contained within the misbehaving
software

Yes, I'll add that to the fault series
