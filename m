To be honest I'm coming round to just exporting a
mte_prepare_page_tags() function which does the clear/set with the lock
held. I doubt it's such a performance critical path that it will cause
any noticeable issues. Then if we run into performance problems in the
future we can start experimenting with extra VM flags etc as necessary.

And from your later email:

This could work, but I worry that it's potential fragile. Also the rules
for what user space can do are not obvious and may be surprising. I'd
also want to look into the likes of mremap() to see how easy it would be
to ensure that we couldn't end up with VM_SHARED (or VM_MTE_ALLOWED)
memory sneaking into a memslot.

Unless you think it's worth complicating the ABI in the hope of avoiding
the big lock overhead I think it's probably best to stick with the big
lock at least until we have more data on the overhead.

kvm_set_spte_gfn() is only used for the MMU notifier path (e.g. if a
memslot is changed by the VMM). For the initial access we will normally
fault the page into stage 2 with user_mem_abort().

Thanks for the review.
