This series is primarily motivated from an adhoc list from Mark Rutland
during our previous ID_ISAR6 discussion [1]. The current proposal also
accommodates some more suggestions from Will and Suzuki.

This series adds missing 32 bit system registers (ID_PFR2, ID_DFR1 and
ID_MMFR5), adds missing features bits on all existing system registers
(32 and 64 bit) and some other miscellaneous changes. While here it also
includes a patch which does macro replacement for various open bits shift
encodings for various CPU ID registers. There is a slight re-order of the
patches here as compared to the previous version (V1).

This series is based on v5.7-rc1. All feature bits enabled here can be
referred in ARM DDI 0487F.a specification. Though I have tried to select
appropriate values for each new feature being added here, there might be
some inconsistencies (or mistakes). In which case, please do let me know
if anything needs to change. Thank you.

- Added ID_DFR1 and ID_MMFR5 system register definitions per Will
- Added remaining features bits for relevant 64 bit system registers per Will
- Changed commit message on [PATCH 5/7] regarding TraceFilt feature per Suzuki
- Changed ID_PFR2.CSV3 (FTR_STRICT -> FTR_NONSTRICT) as 64 bit registers per Will
- Changed ID_PFR0.CSV2 (FTR_STRICT -> FTR_NONSTRICT) as 64 bit registers per Will
