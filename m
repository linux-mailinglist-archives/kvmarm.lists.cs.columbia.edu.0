Yes, Eric pointed out that I was mistaken and there is no check being done for
base + size > kvm_phys_size().

What I was trying to say is that this check is better done when the user creates a
Redistributor region, not when a VCPU is first run. We have everything we need to
make the check when a region is created, why wait until the VCPU is run?

For example, vgic_v3_insert_redist_region() is called each time the adds a new
Redistributor region (via either of the two APIs), and already has a check for the
upper limit overflowing (identical to the check in vgic_v3_check_base()). I would
add the check against the maximum IPA size there.

Also, because vgic_v3_insert_redist_region() already checks for overflow, I
believe the overflow check in vgic_v3_check_base() is redundant.

As far as I can tell, vgic_v3_check_base() is there to make sure that the
Distributor doesn't overlap with any of the Redistributors, and because the
Redistributors and the Distributor can be created in any order, we defer the check
until the first VCPU is run. I might be wrong about this, someone please correct
me if I'm wrong.

Also, did you verify that KVM is also doing this check for GICv2? KVM does
something similar and calls vgic_v2_check_base() when mapping the GIC resources,
and I don't see a check for the maximum IPA size in that function either.

Thanks,

Alex
