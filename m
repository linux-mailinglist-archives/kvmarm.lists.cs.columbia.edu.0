We don't check for any flags today, so in a way adding checks would be 
ABI breakage.

And as Marc pointed out, all of the counters are basically virtual 
through perf. So if you report 31 counters, you end up spawning 31 perf 
counters which get multiplexed, so it would work (albeit not be terribly 
accurate).

That leaves identification bits as something we can check for. But do we 
really have to? What's the worst thing that can happen? KVM user space 
can shoot themselves in the foot. Well, they can also set PC to an 
invalid value. If you do bad things you get bad results :). As long as 
it's not a security risk, I'm not sure the benefits of checking outweigh 
the risks.

Yes :).
