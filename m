The problem came out from discussions with our GIC engineers and what we
talked about at that time was IHI 0069E 9.11.36 - the description of the
Valid field:

"Writing a new value to any bit of GICR_VPENDBASER, other than
GICR_VPENDBASER.Valid, when GICR_VPENDBASER.Valid==1 is UNPREDICTABLE."

It looks like we should first clear the Valid and then write something
else. We might have some mis-understanding about this statement..

Yes. I obviously missed these two points when writing this patch.

No, nothing in v4.1 spec supports me :-(  The above has been forwarded
to Hisilicon and I will confirm these with them. It would be easy for
hardware to handle the PendingLast/DB when clearing Valid, I think.


Thank you,
