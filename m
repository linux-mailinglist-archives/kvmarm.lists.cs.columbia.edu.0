How would a kernel module (or BPF program) get the data to userspace?
The KVM stats interface that Jing added requires KVM to know how to
get the data when handling the read() syscall.

I think this can be mitigated by requiring sufficient justification
when adding a new stat to KVM. There has to be a real use-case and it
has to be explained in the changelog. If a stat has a use-case for one
cloud provider, it will likely be useful to other cloud providers as
well.

This brings up a good discussion topic: To what extent are the KVM
stats themselves an ABI? I don't think this is documented anywhere.
The API itself is completely dynamic and does not hardcode a list of
stats or metadata about them. Userspace has to read stats fd to see
what's there.

Fwiw we just deleted the lpages stat without any drama.
