Ok, will take a look.

Sure, will change that.

This is same as in asidalloc wherein the cur_idx starts at 1 for any new
allocation. I think that guarantees VMID 0 is never allocated.  =

Hmm..I had a quick implementation with a separate thread for speculative
load as done in the arm64kpti.tla, but still get the UniqueVMIDPerCPU viola=
tion
error. I will go through the state trace and see whether I can interpret so=
mething :) =

I think KVM sets the CnP here,
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/arch/arm64/include/asm/kvm_m=
mu.h#L264

But I haven't figured out what else we need to do in this new VMID allocato=
r for
CnP case. =

Ok.
