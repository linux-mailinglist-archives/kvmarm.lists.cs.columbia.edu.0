I'll expand on what I understand (or think I do) about RAS at the
moment. It should hopefully highlight anything wrong with my reasoning
for your questions.

DISR_EL1.A being set means a pending physical SError has been
consumed/cleared. The host has already deferred an SError so saving and
restoring (i.e. preserving) DISR_EL1 for the host would mean the
deferred SError is as it was on return to the host.

If there is a pending physical SError, we'd have to keep it pending so
the host can consume it. __guest_enter has the dsb-isb for RAS so
SErrors will become pending, but it doesn't consume them. I can't
remember now whether this was reliable or not; I assumed it was as it is
gated on the RAS config.

The above didn't need an ESB for the host but incorrect assumptions
might change that.

If a physical SError is pending, you leave it pending and go back to the
host so it can consume it.

If there isn't a physical SError pending, either there is no SError at
all (easy) or the SError has already been consumed to DISR_EL1 by a host
ESB and we'd preserve DISR_EL1 for the host to handle however it chooses.

Traps would need to be left pending. Detected but not consumed with the
dsb-isb in __guest_enter.
