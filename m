An alternative (or perhaps "v2" [1]) is to make x86's TDP MMU
arch-neutral and port it to support ARM's stage-2 MMU. This is based
on a few observations:

- The problems that motivated the development of the TDP MMU are not
x86-specific (e.g. parallelizing faults during the post-copy phase of
Live Migration).
- The synchronization in the TDP MMU (read/write lock, RCU for PT
freeing, atomic compare-exchanges for modifying PTEs) is complex, but
would be equivalent across architectures.
- Eventually RISC-V is going to want similar performance (my
understanding is RISC-V MMU is already a copy-paste of the ARM MMU),
and it'd be a shame to re-implement TDP MMU synchronization a third
time.
- The TDP MMU includes support for various performance features that
would benefit other architectures, such as eager page splitting,
deferred zapping, lockless write-protection resolution, and (coming
soon) in-place huge page promotion.
- And then there's the obvious wins from less code duplication in KVM
(e.g. get rid of the RISC-V MMU copy, increased code test coverage,
...).

The side of this I haven't really looked into yet is ARM's stage-2
MMU, and how amenable it would be to being managed by the TDP MMU. But
I assume it's a conventional page table structure mapping GPAs to
HPAs, which is the most important overlap.

That all being said, an arch-neutral TDP MMU would be a larger, more
complex code change than something like this series (hence my "v2"
caveat above). But I wanted to get this idea out there since the
rubber is starting to hit the road on improving ARM MMU scalability.

[1] "v2" as in the "next evolution" sense, not the "PATCH v2" sense :)
