Digging out some old emails (two years ago), the Chrome people may have
found a use for MTE in shared mappings (with memfd_create), though not
sure they took advantage of this yet.

No, the fix is simple as you said.

For a moment I thought an mmap(PROT_MTE, MAP_SHARED) on memfd/tmpfs file
may lead to the same situation but the mmap() itself won't directly
cause allocating the page. The subsequent fault via filemap_map_pages()
seems to take the page lock.

Yeah. We could add another page flag as a lock though I think it should
be the core code that prevents the race.

If we are to do it in the arch code, maybe easier with a custom
ptep_modify_prot_start/end() where we check if it's VM_SHARED and
VM_MTE, take a (big) lock.

In the core code, something like below (well, a partial hack, not tested
and it doesn't handle huge pages but just to give an idea):
