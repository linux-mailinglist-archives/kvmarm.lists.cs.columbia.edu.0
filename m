To successfully migrate between hosts with different CPU implementations it is also necessary to be able to virtualise various ID registers (e.g. MIDR_EL1, REVIDR_EL1, AIDR_EL1) which we have no support for currently.

Yeah, currently we are trying to do both timer freq virtualization and CPU feature virtualization.

Thanks for pointing this out.

I think the most important thing is that we should introduce a concept named CPU baseline which represents a standard platform.
If we bring up a guest with a specific CPU baseline, then this guest can only run on a platform that is compatible with this CPU baseline.
So "baseline" and "compatible" are the key point to promise successful cross-platform migration.


> What we ideally need is a mechanism to communicate to the guest what workarounds are required to successfully run on any of the hosts that the guest may be migrated to. You may also have the situation where the workarounds required for two hosts are mutually incompatible - something needs to understand this and do the "right thing" (most likely just reject this situation, i.e. prevent the migration).

My idea is similar with the "idealised environment", but errata workaround still exists.
We do not provide para-virtualised interface, and migration is restricted between platforms that are compatible with baseline.

Baseline should has two aspects: CPU feature and errata. These platforms that are compatible with a specific baseline should have the corresponding CPU feature and errata.

But to make the problem solvable it either needs to be restricted to platforms which are substantially the same (so the errata list will be identical), or there's work to be done in preparation to deal with migrating a guest successfully between hosts with potentially different errata requirements.

Here we have new platform with 1GHz timer, and old platform is 100MHZ, so we want to solve the cross-platform migration firstly.
