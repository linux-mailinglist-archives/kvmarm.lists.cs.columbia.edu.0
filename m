Let me add another few things:

- KVM/arm is (supposed to be) an architectural hypervisor. It means
  that one of the design goal is to have as few differences as possible
  from the actual hardware. I'm not keen on deviating from it (next
  thing you know, you'll add all the PV horror from Xen, HV, VMware...). 

- The idea of butchering the arm64 mm subsystem to handle a new exotic
  style of exceptions is not something I am looking forward to. We
  might as well PV the whole MMU, Xen style, and be done with it. I'll
  let the arm64 maintainers comment on this though.

- We don't add IMPDEF sysregs, period. That's reserved for the HW. If
  you want to trap, there's the HVC instruction to that effect.

- If this is such a great improvement, where are the performance
  numbers?

- The fact that it apparently cannot work with nesting nor with
  preemption tends to indicate that it isn't future proof.

Thanks,

	M.
