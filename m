Sorry for late response as we had our long holiday last week :)

For kvm will always handle hvc/smc guest exit for the first step, even 
if it is only a simple forwarding, I called the user-space processing as 
"further emulation".

Do you mean that we can move the hypercall struct definition to arch 
specific kvm_host.h? For it is in the common kvm_run structure, we'll 
need to change every kvm supported architectures, including x86, mips, 
powerpc, s390. Is it acceptable?

I found another solution from papr which defines its own hypercall 
structure in the kvm_run union definition:

         /* KVM_EXIT_PAPR_HCALL */
         struct {
             __u64 nr;
             __u64 ret;
             __u64 args[9];
         } papr_hcall;

How about we define a new structure for ARM/ARM64 specifically?

Yes I followed SMC-CC when writing this.

Maybe we don't need to tie it to SMC-CC, and simply load all values in 
args[6] to GP registers...
And then there is either no strong reason to extend hypercall structure 
for ARM.

Yes; I didn't figure out good way to keep compatibility and future 
extension...

Do you mean we add only one co-processor to list all SMC/HVC calls 
kernel will handle? So the reg size should be large enough to hold the 
list, each entry of which contains a #imm and r0/x0 pair? Is the reg 
size fixed by definition or it can be queried by user-space? If it is 
fixed, what's the size should we choose?

Does it make sense to extend the entry to hold the function ID base and 
limit, so that it can describe the whole range for each function group, 
like PSCI, SDEI, etc?

Sounds good. Then it may not be something we need to do in this patch 
set :) We can postpone this change when user-space PSCI is ready.

Sure; I can do that when we determine the interfaces.

I'm not familiar with 32bit, either we don't have 32bit platforms to 
test the code. So my preference is not to make many changes to 32bit...

How about to use the longmode field in hypercall structure? Standard 
service calls will indicate this in function ID, but we may need to know 
before parsing the function ID, isn't it?

Really appreciate your comments and suggestions. They are really helpful.
