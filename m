Hi Zengruan,

Given Marc and Will's thread[1] about a possible alternative way of
handling this I won't do a thorough review as this might not be the best
way of handling the underlying problem, but there's some comments below
for you to consider.

NIT: As defined this is now only a single (multiplexed) hypercall.

You appear to have changed the SMC32/SMC64 bit on the ID, so this is now
a 32-bit SMC, but the calling convention below (returning an int64)
seems to rely on the guest being 64-bit. Any reason for this change?
Given the implementation doesn't accept 32-bit clients and the calling
convention requires returning a 64-bit value for 64-bit guests this
seems wrong to me.

Because you are now multiplexing the two functions you've lost the
parameter which previously was for "The function to query for support".
Which makes this _FEATURES operation fairly pointless (you might as well
just call KVM_PV_LOCK_PREEMPTED and handle the NOT_SUPPORTED error return).
