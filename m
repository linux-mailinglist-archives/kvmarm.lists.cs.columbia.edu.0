Well, are there any objections to saying for the KVM implementation we
observe the WFI wake-up events per the cited section of the ARM ARM?

This is exactly what I was trying to get at with my last mail,
although not quite as eloquently stated. So I completely agree.

Just to check understanding for v2:

We agree that an exit to userspace is fine so it has the opportunity
to do something crazy when the guest attempts a suspend. If a VMM does
nothing and immediately re-enters the kernel, we emulate the suspend
there by waiting for some event to fire, which for our purposes we
will say is an interrupt originating from userspace or the kernel
(WFI). In all, the SUSPEND exit type does not indicate that emulation
terminates with the VMM. It only indicates we are about to block in
the kernel.

If there is some IMPDEF event specific to the VMM, it should signal
the vCPU thread to kick it out of the kernel, make it runnable, and
re-enter. No need to do anything special from the kernel perspective
for this. This is only for the case where we decide to block in the
kernel.

PSCI is vague on this, sadly. DEN0022D.b, 5.4.8 "Implementation
responsibilities: Cache and coherency management states" that for
CPU_SUSPEND, the PSCI implementation must perform a cache clean
operation before entering the powerdown state. I don't see any reason
why SYSTEM_SUSPEND should be excluded from this requirement.
