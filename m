And people have, we know of some ARM SOC's that don't work fully with
NORMAL_NC for this usage. That is already a problem for baremetal
Linux, let alone KVM..

That is why I likened it to SBSA - if you want to build a server SOC
that works with existing server software, you have to support
NORMAL_NC in this way. Even if it isn't architected.

The KVM challenge, at least, is to support a CPU with working
NORMAL_NC to create VM that emulates the same CPU with working
NORMAL_NC.

I didn't quite understand your other remarks though - is there a
problem here? It seems like yes from the other thread you pointed at?

I would think that KVM should mirror the process page table
configuration into the KVM page table and make this into a userspace
problem?

That turns it into a VFIO problem to negotiate with userspace and set
the proper pgprot. At least VFIO has a better chance than KVM to
consult DT or something to learn about the specific device's
properties.

I don't know how VFIO/qemu/etc can make this all work automatically
correctly 100% of the time. It seems to me it is the same problem as
just basic baremetal "WC" is troubled on ARM in general today. Maybe
some tables and a command line option in qemu is the best we can hope
for.

Long ago I asked that the ARM folks could come with some Linux
definition of all the WC-like modes and some arch calls to indicate
which one(s) should be used. Nobody seemed interested in doing that,
so the above SOC was left non-working in mainline Linux..

DHG is an optimization, not a functional requirement. Currently
available CPUs use one of the more expensive barriers that are
architected to include DHG behavior.

In any event, this is an important optimization. It is why ARMv9 is
introducing a new instruction specifically to optmize it.
