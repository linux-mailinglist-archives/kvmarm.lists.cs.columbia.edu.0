Hi Alexandru,

Sorry for the delay; things were a bit hectic at the end of last year, and this
is still on my queue of things to look at.

This sounds neat!

I have a few comments below, I'll try to take a more in-depth look shortly.

I don't think we need to mess with the translation tables here; for a guest to
look at the buffer it's going to have to look at PMBPTR_EL1 (and a guest could
poll that and issue barriers without ever stopping SPE), so we could also force
writebacks when the guest reads PMBPTR_EL1.

This is unfortunate. :/

I agree it's unlikely the a guest would look at this, but I could imagine some
OSs doing this as a sanity-check, since they never expect this to change, and
if it suddenly becomes 1 they might treat this as an error.

Can we require FGT for guest SPE usage?

It's a shame we don't have a mechanism to raise an interrupt prior to the SPE
buffer becoming full, or we could force a writeback each time we hit a
watermark.

I suspect having a maximum size set ahead of time (and pre-allocating the
buffer?) is the right thing to do. As long as it's set to a reasonably large
value we can treat filling the buffer as a collision.

Likewise, aside from the PMBIDR_EL1.P issue, this sounds very nice to me!

Thanks,
Mark.
