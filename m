Hi Marc,

I have tried to enable the NV support in Qemu, and now I can successfully
boot a L2 guest
in Qemu KVM mode.

This patch series looks good from the Qemu side except for two minor
requirements:
(1) Qemu will check whether a feature was supported by the KVM cap when the
user tries
     to enable it in the command line, so a new capability was prefered for
the NV(KVM_CAP_ARM_NV?).
(2) According to the Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst
<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/virt/kvm/api.rst#482-kvm_arm_vcpu_init>,
userspace can call KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT
     multiple times for a given vcpu, but the kvm_vcpu_init_nested() do
have some issue when
     called multiple times(please refer to the detailed comments in patch
63)

Regards,
Haibo
