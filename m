That's the problem. With Anshuman's commit I mentioned above,
pfn_valid() returns true for ZONE_DEVICE mappings (e.g. persistent
memory, not talking about some I/O mapping that requires Device_nGnRE).
So kvm_is_device_pfn() is false for such memory and it may be mapped as
Normal but it is not guaranteed to support tagging.

For user MTE, we get away with this as the MAP_ANONYMOUS requirement
would filter it out while arch_add_memory() will ensure it's mapped as
untagged in the linear map. See another recent fix for hotplugged
memory: d15dfd31384b ("arm64: mte: Map hotplugged memory as Normal
Tagged"). We needed to ensure that ZONE_DEVICE doesn't end up as tagged,
only hoplugged memory. Both handled via arch_add_memory() in the arch
code with ZONE_DEVICE starting at devm_memremap_pages().

I think this should be fine since it's not a MAP_ANONYMOUS (we do allow
MAP_SHARED to be tagged).
