That's sounds like a good idea, but to be honest, I would wait until someone
actually needs it before implementing it. That way we don't risk not taking a use
case into account and then having to rework it.

Good to keep in mind when support is added.

I also think it will not be too bad if we make the change now, but I'm not sure
what you mean by making vmm an alias of target. The patch ignores --vmm is it's
not specified, and if it is specified on the configure command line, then it must
match the value of --target, otherwise configure fails.

Thanks,

Alex
