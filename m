On CPUs that support S2FWB (Armv8.4+), KVM configures the stage 2 page
tables to override the memory attributes of memory accesses, regardless
of the stage 1 page table configurations, and also when the stage 1 MMU
is turned off.  This results in all memory accesses to RAM being
cacheable, including during early boot of the guest.

On CPUs without this feature, memory accesses were non-cacheable during
boot until the guest turned on the stage 1 MMU, and we had to detect
when the guest turned on the MMU, such that we could invalidate all cache
entries and ensure a consistent view of memory with the MMU turned on.
When the guest turned on the caches, we would call stage2_flush_vm()
from kvm_toggle_cache().

However, stage2_flush_vm() walks all the stage 2 tables, and calls
__kvm_flush-dcache_pte, which on a system with S2FWD does ... absolutely
nothing.

We can avoid that whole song and dance, and simply not set TVM when
creating a VM on a system that has S2FWB.

I was only able to test this on the model with cache modeling enabled,
but even removing TVM from HCR_EL2 without having FWB also worked with
that setup, so the testing of this has been light.  It seems like it
should obviously work, but it would be good if someone with access to
appropriate hardware could give this a spin.
