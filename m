No problem; you've provided a tonne of insightful feedback here, so it was
worth the wait. Thanks!

Thanks, that's much better. I'll have to summon up the energy to go through
the others as well...

I think the "hyp" part is useful to distinguish the pkvm code running at EL2
from the pkvm code running at EL1. For example, we have a 'pkvm' member in
'struct kvm_arch' which is used by the _host_ at EL1.

So I'd say either "pkvm_hyp" or "hyp" instead of "shadow". The latter is
nice and short...

Using container_of() here is neat; we can definitely go ahead with that
change. However, looking at this in more detail with Fuad, removing
'struct kvm_shadow_vcpu_state' entirely isn't going to work:

kvm_get_vcpu() makes use of an xarray to hold the vCPUs pointers and this is
really something which we cannot support at EL2 where, amongst other things,
we do not have support for RCU. Consequently, we do need to keep our own
mapping from the shad^H^H^H^Hhyp vCPU to the host vCPU.

We also end up expanding the 'struct kvm_shadow_vcpu_state' structure later
to track additional vCPU state in the hypervisor, for example in the
mega-series:
