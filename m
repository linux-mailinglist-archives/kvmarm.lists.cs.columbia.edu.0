Hi Marc,

It is actually becoming less clear to me what the real benefits of
pre-populating the stage 2 page table are, especially given that we can
provoke a situation where they're faulted in anyhow.  Do you recall if
we had any specific case that motivated us to pre-fault in the pages?

nit: I'm not really sure this indirection makes the code more readable,
but I guess that's a matter of taste.

WHat is actually the rationale for this?

Why is a huge mapping not permitted to device memory?

Are we guaranteed that VM_PFNMAP on the vma results in device mappings?
I'm not convinced this is the case, and it would be better if we can
stick to a single primitive (either kvm_is_device_pfn, or VM_PFNMAP) to
detect device mappings.

As a subsequent patch, I'd like to make sure that at the very least our
memslot prepare function follows the exact same logic for mapping device
memory as a fault-in approach does, or that we simply always fault pages
in.

nit: why don't you just do this when checking kvm_is_device_pfn() and
avoid having logic in two places to deal with this case?

I can't seem to decide for myself if I think there's a sematic
difference between trying to execute from somewhere the VMM has
explicitly told us is device memory and from somewhere which we happen
to have mapped with VM_PFNMAP from user space.  But I also can't seem to
really fault it (pun intended).  Thoughts?


Thanks,
