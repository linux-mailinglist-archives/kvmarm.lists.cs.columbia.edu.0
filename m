I rethinking about the design again and just get one question. Hopefully,
someone have the answer for us. The newly added 3 pseudo registers and
the existing ones like KVM_REG_ARM_PSCI_VERSION are all tied up with
vcpu, instead of VM. I don't think it's correct. I'm not sure if VM-scoped
pseudo registers aren't allowed by ARM architecture or the effort isn't
worthy to support it.

These pseudo registers are introduced to present the available hypercalls,
and then they can be disabled from userspace. In the implementation, these 3
registers are vcpu scoped. It means that multiple vcpus can be asymmetric
in terms of usable hypercalls. For example, ARM_SMCCC_TRNG hypercalls
can be enabled on vcpu0, but disabled on vcpu1. I don't think it's expected.

On the other hand, the information stored in these 3 registers needs to
be migrated through {GET,SET}_ONE_REG by VMM (QEMU). all the information
stored in these 3 registers are all same on all vcpus, which is exactly
as we expect. In migration circumstance, we're transporting identical
information for all vcpus and it's unnecessary.

Thanks,
Gavin
