Commit 31c00d2aeaa2 ("arm64: Disable fine grained traps on boot") zeroed
the fine grained trap registers to prevent unwanted register traps from
occuring. However, for the PMSNEVFR_EL1 register, the corresponding
HDFGRTR_EL2.nPMSNEVFR_EL1 field must be 1 to disable trapping. Set the
field to 1 if FEAT_SPEv1p2 is detected.

Based on v5.14-rc7. Also, we could write 1 << 62 to HDFGRTR_EL2 unconditionally
since the field is RAZ/WI if !FEAT_SPEv1p2. I don't have a strong preference for
either approaches, but I chose this implementation because it's clearer (even
though it's more verbose and it's one extra trap on NV).

Tested on the model, using boot-wrapper built from commit 5cd6238ec4ef
("aarch32: fix .globl replacement"). Without this patch, in NVHE mode, the model
freezes when I try to read PMSNEVFR_EL1. With this patch, the model doesn't hang
when I read the register, but it hangs when I write to it. I've gone throught
the pseudocode for reading and writing to PMSNEVFR_EL1 and from what I can tell
nothing should be trapping the accesses. On top of that, this is what I tried on
the model with this patch applied:

1. VHE mode, I can read and write to PMSNEVFR_EL1 without any issues, so the
hang is not caused by an incorrect EL3 configuration.

2. NVHE mode, I can read and write just fine to *PMSEVFR_EL1*, so the hang is
not caused by an EL2 trap that affects the rest of the profiling control
registers. I have tried printing the HDFGRTR_EL2 value in this situation using
semihosting, the value is what it is programmed by __init_el2_fgt (that is,
1 << 62).

At this point, I am inclined to think it's a model bug because reading works,
but writing causes a hang and that looks very suspicious to me. I'm going to
open a model bug internally and see what comes of it.
