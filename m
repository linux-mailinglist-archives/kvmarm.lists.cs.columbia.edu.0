Those all sound very similar to the AMD SEV world;  there's the special
case for Debug that Peter mentioned; migration is ...complicated and
needs special case that's still being figured out, and as I understand
Device DMA also uses a bounce buffer (and swiotlb in the guest to make
that happen).


I'm not sure about the stories for the IBM hardware equivalents.
