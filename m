I don't think there should be a problem because now the struct pages for
UEFI/ACPI never got to be used by the core mm. They were (rightfully)
skipped by memblock_free_all() from one side and pfn_valid() and
pfn_valid_within() return false for them in various pfn walkers from the
other side.

I surely have no access for such machines :)
