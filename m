Yes, KVM_{GET,SET}_ONE_REG is the ideal interface for migration. You're
correct we're only concerned by software signaled event and the one for
Async PF.

I didn't look into Raghavendra's series deeply. Actually, a lump of
registers can be avoid after 2048 byte size is specified in its
encoding. I think 2048 bytes are enough for now since there are
only two supported events.

In the future, we probably have varied number of SDEI events to
be migrated. In that case, we need to add a new bit to the encoding
of the pseudo system register, so that VMM (QEMU) can support
variable sized system register and keep reading and writing on
these registers on migration:

     PSEUDO_SDEI_ADDR: 64-bits in width
     PSEUDO_SDEI_DATA: has varied size

PSEUDO_SDEI_ADDR is used to (1) Indicate the size of PSEUDO_SDEI_DATA
(2) The information to be read/written, for example the (shared/private)
registered events on VM and vCPU, VCPU state.

PSEUDO_SDEI_DATA is used to (1) Retrieved information or that to be
written. (2) Flags to indicate current block of information is the
last one or not.

I was overthinking on the usage of SDEI. I had the assumption that SDEI
may be used by emulated devices to inject SDEI events in VMM. It can
even be done through PSEUDO_SDEI_{ADDR, DATA} in future. For now, the
software signaled and Async PF events are concerned, Async PF event
is always raised by host/KVM. So we needn't it for now and I will drop
this functionality, actually the whole ioctl commands and migration
support in next respin, as you suggested :)

Thanks,
Gavin
