Yeah my suggestion probably is not a good idea, ie. introducing such
VCPU targets. I was simply confused by the fact we introduce in this
series quite intricate consistency checks but given the fact we miss the
spec rev information we are not exhaustive in terms of checking. So it
is sometimes difficult to review against the spec.

understood. I will look at the spec in more details on my next review
cycle. Looking forward to reviewing the next version ;-)

Thanks
