Ah, you're right, HLT is an "automatic" exit and the CPU takes care of adjusting
RIP.  TDX is the only one that requires a hypercall.

PIO shouldn't require instruction decoding or a #VC handler.  What I was thinking
is that the guest in the selftest would make a direct #VMGEXIT/TDCALL to request
PIO instead of executing an OUT.

Yeah, I was thinking it could be done at the lowest level vm_create() helper.
We'll need to expand vm_create() (or add yet another layer to avoid modifying a
pile of tests) to allow opting out of initializing ucall, e.g. sev_migrate_tests.c
needs to create multiple concurrent VMs, but happily doesn't need ucall support.

Again, I was thinking that it would be done unconditionally by ucall_init(), i.e.
would be automatically handled by the selftest framework and would Just Work for
individual tests.

Ah, right, I forgot that querying the vCPU ID would require a hypercall.
