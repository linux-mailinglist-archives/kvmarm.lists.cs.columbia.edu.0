Does changing the slot require some KVM API call? Can we intercept it
and do the checks there?

Maybe a better alternative for the time being is to add a new
kvm_is_zone_device_pfn() and force KVM_PGTABLE_PROT_DEVICE if it returns
true _and_ the VMM asked for MTE in guest. We can then only set
PG_mte_tagged if !device.

We can later relax this further to Normal Non-cacheable for ZONE_DEVICE
memory (via a new KVM_PGTABLE_PROT_NORMAL_NC) or even Normal Cacheable
if we manage to change the behaviour of the architecture.

Yeah, let's scrap this idea. We set PG_mte_tagged in user_mem_abort(),
so we already know it's a page potentially containing tags. On
restoring from swap, we need to check for MTE metadata irrespective of
whether the user pte is tagged or not, as you already did in patch 1.
I'll get back to that and look at the potential races.

BTW, after a page is restored from swap, how long do we keep the
metadata around? I think we can delete it as soon as it was restored and
PG_mte_tagged was set. Currently it looks like we only do this when the
actual page was freed or swapoff. I haven't convinced myself that it's
safe to do this for swapoff unless it guarantees that all the ptes
sharing a page have been restored.
