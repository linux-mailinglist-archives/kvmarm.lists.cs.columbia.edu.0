I didn't say, nor suggest that. I suggested that *this* commit could be changed
to use the architectural terminology, which I assumed it's the most natural
terminology to use in a patch series which has the goal to emulate the
architectural EL2. Obviously, opinions vary.

So HYP means EL2 or EL2 with the role of a hypervisor? Because when booting KVM
on a machine without FEAT_VHE, dmesg uses "hyp mode" to refer to EL2 without
FEAT_VHE. And is_hyp_ctxt(), which this series adds, refers to EL0 with
HCR_EL2.TGE set.

I've given these examples before (and others), in the end it's up to you how
precise you want the terminology to be and how easy to understand you want to
make the code.

Thanks,
Alex
