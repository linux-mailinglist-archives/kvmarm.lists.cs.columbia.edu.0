Hi Oliver,

I wonder how this compares to the idea of initializing the TSC via a 
synchronized (nanoseconds, TSC) pair. 
(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20201130133559.233242-2-mlevitsk@redhat.com), 
and whether it makes sense to apply that idea to ARM as well.  If so, it 
certainly is a good idea to use the same capability and ioctl, even 
though the details of the struct would be architecture-dependent.

In your patches there isn't much architecture dependency in struct 
kvm_system_counter_state.  However,  Maxim's also added an 
MSR_IA32_TSC_ADJUST value to the struct, thus ensuring that the host 
could write not just an arbitrary TSC value, but also tie it to an 
arbitrary MSR_IA32_TSC_ADJUST value.  Specifying both in the same ioctl 
simplifies the userspace API.
