mprotect.c only has a call to set_pte_at() not set_pte_at_notify(). And
AFAICT the MMU notifiers are called to invalidate only in
change_pmd_range(). So the stage 2 mappings would be invalidated rather
than populated. However I believe this should cause synchronisation
because of the KVM mmu_lock. So from my reading you are right an
mprotect() can't race.

MAP_SHARED between multiple VMs is then the only potential problem.

I'll just update the comment for now.
