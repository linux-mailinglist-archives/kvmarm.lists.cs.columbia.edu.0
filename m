Huh, somewhat missed that email, apologies for the delay.

Of course, you'd need some sort of advertising of this new behaviour.

One thing I would like to add to the current state of thing is an
indication of whether the effects of a sysreg being written from
userspace are global or local to a vcpu. You'd need a new capability,
and an extra flag added to the encoding of each register.

I don't disagree. But I doubt switching to a different API altogether
is the solution to this.

But the very purpose of this API is to support discoverability. If we
can't support it, then we might as well declare the whole API
deprecated and restart from scratch.

No, I'm not seriously suggesting this :-/.

It is the latter that I'm suggesting.

I'm perfectly happy with suboptimal to start with, and find ways to
make it better once we have a clear path forward. I just don't want to
conflate the two.

Thanks,
