So I took a stab at the performance aspect, and it took me a while to find
something where it actually makes a difference. The trick is to create *a
lot* of interrupts. This is my setup now:
- GICv3 and ITS
- 5.1.0 kernel vs. 5.1.0 plus Marc's rebased "ITS cache" patches on top
- 4 VCPU guest on a 4 core machine
- passing through a M.2 NVMe SSD (or a USB3 controller) to the guest
- running FIO in the guest, with:
  - 4K block size, random reads, queue depth 16, 4 jobs (small)
  - 1M block size, sequential reads, QD 1, 1 job (big)

For the NVMe disk I see a whopping 19% performance improvement with Marc's
series (for the small blocks). For a SATA SSD connected via USB3.0 I still
see 6% improvement. For NVMe there were 50,000 interrupts per second on
the host, the USB3 setup came only up to 10,000/s. For big blocks (with
IRQs in the low thousands/s) the win is less, but still a measurable 3%.

Now that I have the setup, I can rerun experiments very quickly (given I
don't loose access to the machine), so let me know if someone needs
further tests.

Cheers,
Andre.
