+ Steven as he added the KVM and swap support for MTE.

We already have some corner cases where the PG_mte_tagged logic fails
even for MAP_PRIVATE (but page shared with CoW). Adding this on top for
KVM MAP_SHARED will potentially make things worse (or hard to reason
about; for example the VMM sets PROT_MTE as well). I'm more inclined to
get rid of PG_mte_tagged altogether, always zero (or restore) the tags
on user page allocation, copy them on write. For swap we can scan and if
all tags are 0 and just skip saving them.

Another aspect is a change in the KVM ABI with this patch. It's probably
not that bad since it's rather a relaxation but it has the potential to
confuse the VMM, especially as it doesn't know whether it's running on
older kernels or not (it would have to probe unless we expose this info
to the VMM in some other way).

TBH, I can't mentally model all the corner cases, so maybe a formal
model would help (I can have a go with TLA+, though not sure when I find
a bit of time this summer). If we get rid of PG_mte_tagged altogether,
this would simplify things (hopefully).

As you noticed, the problem is that setting PG_mte_tagged and clearing
(or restoring) the tags is not an atomic operation. There are places
like mprotect() + CoW where one task can end up with stale tags. Another
is shared memfd mappings if more than one mapping sets PROT_MTE and
there's the swap restoring on top.

mte_sync_tags() already sets PG_mte_tagged prior to clearing the page
tags. The reason was so that multiple concurrent set_pte_at() would not
all rush to clear (or restore) the tags. But we do have the risk of one
thread accessing the page with the stale tags (copy_user_highpage() is
worse as the tags would be wrong in the destination page). I'd rather be
consistent everywhere with how we set the flags.

However, I find it easier to reason about if we used the new flag as a
lock. IOW, if PG_mte_tagged is set, we know that tags are valid. If not
set, take the PG_mte_locked flag, check PG_mte_tagged again and
clear/restore the tags followed by PG_mte_tagged (and you can use
test_and_set_bit_lock() for the acquire semantics).

It would be interesting to benchmark the cost of always zeroing the tags
on allocation and copy when MTE is not in use:

If that's negligible, we can hopefully get rid of PG_mte_tagged. For
swap we could move the restoring to arch_do_swap_page() (but move the
call one line above set_pte_at() in do_swap_page()).
