Its the size of the hole that has opened up in the address map. The error was very likely
to be much smaller, but all we can do is unmap pages.
Transparent huge-pages are split up to minimise the impact. This code is for hugetlbfs
(?), whose pages are dedicated for that use, so don't get split.

arch/arm64/mm/fault.c::do_page_fault() has:
|	lsb = PAGE_SHIFT;
|	if (fault & VM_FAULT_HWPOISON_LARGE)
|		lsb = hstate_index_to_shift(VM_FAULT_GET_HINDEX(fault));
|
|	arm64_force_sig_mceerr(BUS_MCEERR_AR, (void __user *)addr, lsb,

(I assume its a shift because bytes in the signal union are precious)

This changes the meaning, vma_pagesize is a value like 4K, not a shift like 12.

But yes, caching the shift value under the mmap_sem and passing it in is the
right-thing-to-do(tm). I have a patch which I'll post, once I remember how to test this thing!



Thanks,

James
