This only works on the assumption that the VM is in fact running. In the
case of the GIC ITS, I would expect that the VM has already been paused
in preparation for serialization. So, there would never be a vCPU thread
that would ever detect the kick.

I was trying to allude to something like this by flat-out requiring
ring + bitmap on arm64.

Otherwise, we'd either need to:

 (1) Document the features that explicitly depend on ring + bitmap (i.e.
 GIC ITS, whatever else may come) such that userspace sets up the
 correct configuration based on what its using. The combined likelihood
 of both KVM and userspace getting this right seems low.

 (2) Outright reject the use of features that require ring + bitmap.
 This pulls in ordering around caps and other UAPI.

The third option would be to toss DIRTY_LOG_RING_ACQ_REL this release
and instead add DIRTY_LOG_RING2, this time checking the flags.
