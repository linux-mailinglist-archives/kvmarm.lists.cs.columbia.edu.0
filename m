I believe we are in agreement then. I don't believe there is any need
to prohibit register accesses for the case of AArch32 EL1, given the
fact that it is impossible to read the ID_AA64*_EL1 registers from the
guest anyway.

We can go ahead and let userspace play with those registers as much as
it wants, it delightfully has no affect :)
