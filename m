The VMM can mess things up in many ways. While KVM should protect itself
from the VMM, it shouldn't try to protect the VMM from the VMM itself. In
this case, the risk here isn't that we allow the VMM to do something that
can harm KVM, or even the guest. The risk is only that the VMM fails to do
what it wanted to do (assuming it didn't want to expose unknown features
to the guest). I.e. the risk here is only that the VMM has a bug, and it's
an easily detectable bug. I say let the VMM developers manage it.

Yes, I think we can probably manage this in the VMM, and maybe/probably
that's the better place to manage it.

Your assumptions align with mine. It seems as we move towards CPU models,
get-reg-list's role will likely only be to confirm a host supports the
minimum required. We should probably implement/change the VMM to allow
migrating from a host with more registers to one with less as long as
the one with less includes all the required registers. Of course we
also need to ensure that any registers we don't want to require are
not exposed to the guest, but I guess that's precisely what we're trying
to do with this series for at least some pseudo registers.

Thanks,
