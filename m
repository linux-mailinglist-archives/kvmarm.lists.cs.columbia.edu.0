Yes, I will split the patches into small ones for easier review
in next revision. Thanks for your comments :)

Yes, I will use live migration as the justification in next revision :)

Currently, the asynchronous page fault is only supported for memory access in
guest's userspace, but we needn't to be sticky to the use model in future. It
means the asynchornous page fault could be supported for memory access in guest's
kernel space where the interrupt can be disabled or masked. So NMI is needed and
SDEI fits the use model very well as Paolo replied in another thread.

About the feature to support SDEI virtualization, I thought there might be some
use cases where the emulated devices need inject SDEI event to guest. However,
I'm not too much familiar with the architecture yet. If it's required by the
emulated devices, there are more more justifications to merge the code. However,
the implementation itself isn't simple and I would say it's complicated.

Thanks,
Gavin
