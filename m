You're right, as usual. But A55 SBCs are apparently hard to find - most
of the SBCs I've seen are A53/A72 (which I thought would be enough,
until we found out about the TGran16 problem), and now that I looked for
A55-based SBCs, I couldn't find one with a big enough memory (we're
looking at 4GB+, so that we can provide the VM at least 2GB and still
have adequate performance).

Yes, that seems to be what's happening. We'll have to think of a
different mechanism for trapping access from user-mode straight to the
hypervisor - or, alternatively, move our custom code into the kernel. I
know it's a bit off-topic, but thank you for your advice!

Of course! We already have a patched QEMU that works. I'll have to tidy
up the code a bit, extract it out of our fork, and apply it to the
mainline QEMU before submitting. Will take care of it once I deal with
the 32-bit support.
