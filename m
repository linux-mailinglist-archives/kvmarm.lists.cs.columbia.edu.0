xor-ing them together would be more fun - and equally valid in this imp-def world!

The alternative is to make this depend on the list of CPUs where we know the combining
behaviour. That isn't great either, as its an unmaintainable-and-outdated list of
all-cortex-cores.

Gah!. I'm off to the stationery cupboard for a brown paper bag....
