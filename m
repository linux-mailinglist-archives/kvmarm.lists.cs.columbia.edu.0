+=====================================
+SDEI Virtualization Support for ARM64
+=====================================
+
+Arm specification DEN0054/C defines Software Delegated Exception Interface
+(SDEI). It provides a mechanism for registering and servicing system events
+from system firmware. The interface is offered by a higher exception level
+to a lower exception level, in other words by a secure platform firmware
+to hypervisor or hypervisor to OS or both.
+
+https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0054/c
+
+KVM/arm64 implements the defined hypercalls in the specification so that
+the system events can be registered and serviced from KVM hypervisor to
+the guest OS.
+
+SDEI Event Management
+=====================
+
+Each SDEI event is associated and identified with a 32-bit number. The
+lower 24-bits is the event number, but other bits are reserved or used
+for vendor defined events. In KVM/arm64 implementation, bit 22 and 23
+are further reserved to identify the events visible to the implementation.
+Value 0x1 should be seen in this field for those KVM/arm64 visible events.
+In the meanwhile, event number 0x0 is also supported since it is used by
+SDEI_EVENT_SIGNAL hypercall.
+
+The SDEI event needs to be exposed through ioctl interface by VMM to
+hypervisor before the guest is able to register it. The exposed event
+is represented by ``struct kvm_sdei_exposed_event``. The registered event
+is represented by ``struct kvm_sdei_registered_event``, whose instances
+are created on SDEI_EVENT_REGISTER hypercall. There is only one registered
+event instance in one particular VM no matter what event type is. The
+registered event can be injected and delivered to one specific vcpu in
+forms of vcpu event. ``struct kvm_sdei_vcpu_event`` describes vcpu events.
+On the particular vcpu, one vcpu event instance can be shared by multiple
+events.
+
+The execution runs into SDEI context when vcpu event is handled. The
+interrupted or preempted context should be saved to vcpu state, which
+is represented by ``struct kvm_sdei_vcpu``. After that, the SDEI event
+handler, which was provided by SDEI_EVENT_REGISTER hypercall is invoked.
+SDEI_EVENT_COMPLETE or SDEI_EVENT_COMPLETE_AND_RESUME hypercall must be
+issued before the SDEI event handler is to complete. When one of these
+two hypercalls is received, the interrupted or preempted context is
+restored from vcpu state for execution.
+
+When migration happens, the status of one particular SDEI event is not
+deterministic. So we need to support migration for the aforementioned
+structures or objects. The information capable of migration in these
+objects are put into separate data structures, which are the corresponding
+state variant in kvm_sdei_state.h. Besides, ioctl command are introduced
+to read and write them on the source and destination VM during migration.
+
+IOCTL Commands
+==============
+
+KVM_ARM_SDEI_COMMAND

+
+    struct kvm_sdei_cmd {
+        __u32        cmd;
+        union {
+            __u32    version;
+            __u32    count;
+        };
+        union {
+            struct kvm_sdei_exposed_event_state     *exposed_event_state;
+            struct kvm_sdei_registered_event_state  *registered_event_state;
+            struct kvm_sdei_vcpu_event_state        *vcpu_event_state;
+            struct kvm_sdei_vcpu_state              *vcpu_state;
+            __u64                                   num;
+        };
+    };
+
+The SDEI ioctl command is identified by KVM_ARM_SDEI_COMMAND and ``cmd``
+in the argument ``struct kvm_sdei_cmd`` provides further command to be
+executed.
+
+KVM_SDEI_CMD_GET_VERSION
+------------------------
+
+:Type: vm ioctl
+:Parameters: struct kvm_sdei_cmd
+:Returns: 0 on success, < 0 on error
+
+On success, the implementation version is returned in ``version`` of
+``struct kvm_sdei_cmd``. This version is different from that of the
+followed SDEI specification. The implementation version is used to tell
+the coherence extent to the following specification. For example, the
+SDEI interrupt binding event is defined in SDEI v1.1 specification,
+but it is not supported in current implementation.
+
+KVM_SDEI_CMD_GET_EXPOSED_EVENT_COUNT

+:Returns: 0 on success, < 0 on error
+
+This ioctl command is used prior to KVM_SDEI_CMD_GET_EXPOSED_EVENT, to
+prepare ``exposed_event_state`` of ``struct kvm_sdei_cmd`` for that
