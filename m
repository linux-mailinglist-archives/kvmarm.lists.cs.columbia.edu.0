When a slot is added by the VMM, if it asked MTE in guest (I guess
that's an opt-in by the VMM, haven't checked the other patches), can we
reject it if it's is going to be mapped as Normal Cacheable but it is a
ZONE_DEVICE (i.e. !kvm_is_device_pfn() + one of David's suggestions to
check for ZONE_DEVICE)? This way we don't need to do more expensive
checks in set_pte_at().

We could simplify the set_pte_at() further if we require that the VMM
has a PROT_MTE mapping. This does not mean it cannot have two mappings,
the other without PROT_MTE. But at least we get a set_pte_at() when
swapping in which has PROT_MTE.

We could add another PROT_TAGGED or something which means PG_mte_tagged
set but still mapped as Normal Untagged. It's just that we are short of
pte bits for another flag.

Can we somehow identify when the S2 pte is set and can we get access to
the prior swap pte? This way we could avoid changes to set_pte_at() for
S2 faults.
