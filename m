Hi,

I do think removing the loop is a good idea. I tested this patch, and when
running a single test, it makes the run 3 seconds faster on an Cortex-A53
for me - selftest-smp and selftest-vectors-kernel went from taking 12s to
9s. Doesn't make much of a difference when running all the tests (those
take for me 5m10s without the patch, 5m6.5s with the patch), but when
running a single test the 25% speed improvement is noticeable.

Though I'm not sure how you managed to get MAX_SMP to go down to 6 cores on
a 12 core machine. MAX_SMP is initialized to $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN),
so the body of the loop should never execute. I also tried it on a 6 core
machine, and MAX_SMP was 6, not 3.

Am I missing something?

Thanks,
Alex
