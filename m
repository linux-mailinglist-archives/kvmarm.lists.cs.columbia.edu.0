Hi Raghavendra,

I don't think we need a CAP that has to be enabled or to make any
assumptions or policy decisions in the kernel. I think we just need to
provide a bit more information to the VMM when it checks if KVM has the
CAP. If KVM would tell the VMM how may pseudo registers there are, which
can be done with the return value of the CAP, then the VMM code could be
something like this

  r = check_cap(KVM_CAP_ARM_HVC_FW_REG_BMAP);
  if (r) {
    num_regs = r;

    for (idx = 0; idx < num_regs; ++idx) {
      reg = hvc_fw_reg(idx);

      if (idx > vmm_last_known_idx) {
        ...
      } else {
        ...
      }
    }
  }

With this, the VMM is free to decide if it wants to clear all registers
greater than the last index it was aware of or if it wants to let those
registers just get exposed to the guest without knowing what's getting
exposed. Along with documenting that by default everything gets exposed
by KVM, which is the backwards compatible thing to do, then the VMM has
been warned and given everything it needs to manage its guests.

Another thing that might be nice is giving userspace control of how many
pseudo registers show up in get-reg-list. In order to migrate from a host
with a more recent KVM to a host with an older KVM[*] we should only
expose the number of pseudo registers that the older host is aware of.
The VMM would zero these registers out anyway, in order to be compatible
for migration, but that's not enough when they also show up in the list
(at least not with QEMU that aborts migration when the destination
expects less registers than what get-reg-list provides)

[*] This isn't a great idea, but it'd be nice if we can make it work,
because users may want to rollback upgrades or, after migrating to a
host with a newer kernel, they may want to migrate back to where they
started.

Thanks,
drew
