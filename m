You are correct, the commit message doesn't explain why locking is removed,
which makes the commit confusing. I will try to do a better job for the
next iteration (if we decide to keep this patch).

I removed locking because the physical allocator by the end of the series
will end up being used only by arm64 to create the idmap, which is done on
the boot CPU and with the MMU off. After that, the translation table
allocator functions will use the page allocator, which can be used
concurrently.

Looking at the spinlock implementation, spin_lock() doesn't protect from
the concurrent accesses when the MMU is disabled (lock->v is
unconditionally set to 1). Which means that spin_lock() does not work (in
the sense that it doesn't protect against concurrent accesses) on the boot
path, which doesn't need a spinlock anyway, because no secondaries are
online secondaries. It also means that spinlocks don't work when
AUXINFO_MMU_OFF is set. So for the purpose of simplicity I preferred to
drop it entirely.

Thanks,
Alex
