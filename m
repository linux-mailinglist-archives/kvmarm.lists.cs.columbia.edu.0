I grepped for system error in Arm IHI 0069F, and turns out there's a number of
ways to make the GIC generate one:

- When programming the ITS

- On a write to ICC_DIR_EL1 (or the corresponding virtual CPU interface register)
with split priority drop/interrupt deactivation is not enabled.

- On a write to GICV_AEOIR or GICC_DIR.

ITS and the legacy GICv2 interface is memory mapped, so I am going to trust that
KVM emulates that correctly and avoids putting the GIC into a state that triggers
the SErrors.

The CPU interface registers are accessed directly by the guest, then changing that
to trap-and-emulate looks like the only way to avoid the guest from crashing the
host with an SError.

As for making the trap-and-emulate depend on the ICH_VTR_EL2.SEIS being set, that
sounds reasonable to me, considering that there were no reports so far of this
being implemented. And if it turns out that there are device which implement GIC
generated SErrors *correctly* and the trap-and-emulate cost is too much, then we
can always get an errata number from Apple and have the trapping depend on that,
right?
