[All I want for Christmas is... another monster GIC series!]

This rather long series expands the existing GICv4 support to deal with the
new GICv4.1 architecture, which comes with a set of major improvements
compared to v4.0:

- One architectural doorbell per vcpu, instead of one doorbell per VLPI

- Doorbell entirely managed by the HW, with an "at most once" delivery
  guarantee per non-residency phase and only when requested by the
  hypervisor

- A shared memory scheme between ITSs and redistributors, allowing for an
  optimised residency sequence (the use of VMOVP becomes less frequent)

- Support for direct virtual SGI delivery (the injection path still involves
  the hypervisor), at the cost of losing the active state on SGIs. It
  shouldn't be a big deal, but some guest operating systems might notice
  (Linux definitely won't care).

On the other hand, public documentation is not available yet, so that's a
bit annoying...

The series is roughly organised in 5 parts:

(1) Feature detection, errata workaround for TX1
(2) VPE table allocation, new flavours of VMAPP/VMOVP commands
(3) v4.1 doorbell management
(4) Virtual SGI support
(5) Plumbing of virtual SGIs in KVM

Ideally, I'd like to start merging some of this into 5.6.

Notes:

  - This series has uncovered a behaviour that looks like a HW bug on
    the Cavium ThunderX (aka TX1) platform (see patch #3). I'd very
    much welcome some clarification from the Marvell/Cavium folks on
    Cc, as well as an official erratum number if this happens to be an
    actual bug.

    [v3 update]
    People have ignored for two months now, and it is fairly obvious
    that support for this machine is slowly bit-rotting. Maybe I'll
    drop the patch and instead start the process of removing all TX1
    support from the kernel (we'd certainly be better off without it).

* From v2 [2]:
  - Another bunch of fixes thanks to Zenghui Yu's very careful review
  - HW-accelerated SGIs are now optional thanks to new architected
    discovery/selection bits exposed by KVM and used by the guest kernel
  - Rebased on v5.5-rc2

* From v1 [1]:
  - A bunch of minor reworks after Zenghui Yu's review
  - A workaround for what looks like a new and unexpected TX1 bug
  - A subtle reorder of the series so that some patches can go in early
