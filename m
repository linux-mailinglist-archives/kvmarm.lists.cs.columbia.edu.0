There are some tests checking that case (e.g., AF set by HW), but they
also do it while interacting with dirty-logging, userfaultfd, and/or RO
memslots. Some checks are clearly dealing with architectural behavior,
while others are not that clear. Let me use this sample test to get more
specific.  This test deals with HW setting the AF bit on a punched hole
backed by userfaultfd:

TEST_UFFD(guest_exec, with_af, CMD_HOLE_PT, ...):
	1. set TCR_EL1.HA and clear the AF in the test-data PTE,
	2. punch a hole on the test-data PTE page, and register it for
	   userfaultfd,
	3. execute code in the test-data page; this triggers a S1PTW,
	4. assert that there is a userfaultfd _write_ fault on the PT page,
	5. assert that the test-data instruction was executed,
	6. assert that the AF is set on the test-data PTE,

IIUC, only checking for architectural behavior implies skipping step 4.
And I agree, it might be a good idea to skip 4, as it actually depends
on whether the kernel has only the previous commit, or both the previous
and this one. The fault is a _write_ at this commit, and a _read_ at the
previous.

The issue is that there are some cases where checking KVM behavior could
be useful. For example, this dirty_logging test can also help (besides
testing dirty-logging) for checking regressions of commit c4ad98e4b72c
("KVM: arm64: Assume write fault on S1PTW permission fault on
instruction fetch"):

TEST_DIRTY_LOG(guest_exec, with_af, ...)
	1. set TCR_EL1.HA and clear the AF in the test-data PTE,
	2. enable dirty logging on the PT memslot,
	3. execute code in the test-data page; this triggers a S1PTW,
	4. assert that the test-data PTE page is dirty on the log,
	5. assert that the test-data instruction was executed,
	6. assert that the AF is set on the test-data PTE,

Step 4 above is not exactly checking architectural behavior, but I think
it's still useful.

So, regarding what to do with page_fault_test. As a start, I need to go
through all tests and make sure they pass at both this and the previous
commit. Next, I have to identify other tests that also need to be
relaxed a bit (removing some test asserts).

Ricardo
