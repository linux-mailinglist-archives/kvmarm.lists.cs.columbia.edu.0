I'm not sure I follow how you'd use HVC to inject a signal into a guest;
the HVC would have to be issued by the guest to the host. Unless you're
injecting the signal via some other mechanism (e.g. an interrupt), and
the guest issues the HVC in response to that?

Take a look at the SMCCC / SMC Calling Convention:

 https://developer.arm.com/docs/den0028/c

... that defines ranges set aside for hypervisor-specific usage, and
despite its name it also applies to HVC calls.

There's been intermittent work to add a probing story for that, so that
part is subject to change, but for prototyping you can just choose an
arbitray number in that range -- just be suere to mention in the commit
and cover letter that this part isn't complete.

Yes, similar applies here.

If the guest is making a hypercall, you can return the fault info as the
response in GPRs, so I don't think you need to touch any architectural
fault registers.

Thanks,
Mark.
