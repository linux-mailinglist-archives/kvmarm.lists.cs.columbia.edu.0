I agree with you, it takes a finite time for any interrupt controller (in
our case, the GIC) to deassert the interrupt line to the CPU after a device
has deasserted the interrupt line to the interrupt controller. That's why
device drivers are usually robust in dealing with spurious interrupts.

It looks to me that the way irq_handler() treats spurious interrupts might
lead to tests being incorrectly treated as failed, which is going to be a
pain to reproduce and diagnose.

@Eric, was there a particular reason for this approach?

Thanks,
Alex
