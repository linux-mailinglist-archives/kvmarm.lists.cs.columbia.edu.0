ESR_EL{1,2} were originally 32-bit register, then were extended to 64-bit
with the upper 32 bits RES0, and in ARM DDI 0487H.a the FEAT_LS64 feature
was added which makes use of the upper bits. This series aims to teach
Linux to treat it consistently as a 64-bit register with the goal of making
it easier to add support in the future for features that make use of the
upper 32 bits.

Patches #1 ("arm64: Make ESR_ELx_xVC_IMM_MASK compatible with assembly")
and #2 ("arm64: compat: Do not treat syscall number as ESR_ELx for a bad
syscall") are fixes for some minor issues which I found while working on
changing ESR_ELx to 64-bit.

Patches #3 ("arm64: Treat ESR_ELx as a 64bit register") and #4 ("KVM:
arm64: Treat ESR_EL2 as a 64-bit register") are where the change is
implemented. I chose to make the KVM a separate patch because KVM prefers
u64 for the registers.

And in patch #5 ("KVM: arm64: uapi: Add kvm_debug_exit_arch.hsr_high") I
add a new field to the user API struct kvm_debug_exit_arch that represents
the higher 32 bits (details in the patch).

Tested by running ltp and kvm-unit-tests on a rockpro64.
