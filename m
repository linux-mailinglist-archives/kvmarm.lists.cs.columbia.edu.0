I believe there has been a misunderstanding. I asked you if I can pickup *some* of
your patches, not all of them.

Your impression is correct. The buffer test is my original work. No code has been
borrowed from your patches, hence why the differences might look like arbitrary
changes.

I believe there are some correctness issues with your patches, and I decided to
send my own test which I used when developing KVM SPE support instead of rebasing
your tests.

It was not my intention to make you feel that your contribution is not appreciated
or ignored. Let's work on merging your series first and then I'll rebase and
resend any tests from my series which were not included.

Thanks,
Alex
