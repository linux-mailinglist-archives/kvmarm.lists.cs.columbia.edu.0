Ah, I think I understand now. Were you running 32-bit arm tests? If so,
it'd be good to point that out explicitly in the commit message (the
'arm:' prefix in the summary is ambiguous).

Assuming the loop body was running because it needed to reduce MAX_SMP to
8 or lower for 32-bit arm tests, then we should be replacing the loop with
something that caps MAX_SMP at 8 for 32-bit arm tests instead.

Thanks,
drew
