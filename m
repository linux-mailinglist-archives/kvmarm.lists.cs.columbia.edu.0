Hello!

Do you have hardware that uses PBHA? If so, what does the SoC do in response to
which bits, and what workload needs that behaviour?

This series is a start at trying to work out what linux needs to support to makeuse of existing SoCs using PBHA.


PBHA is a feature that adds an extra four bits to each read or write transaction
for the SoC implementer to do - whatever they like with! An obvious example
would be a hint for whether the access should allocate (or not) in the system
cache. The hint would allow better performance for some SoC specific workloads.

The arm-arm doesn't define what the bits do, only where in the page tables they
come from. It also doesn't define how these bits are combined between stage1
and stage2.

It appears that all of Arm's Cortex cores with the feature do the stage1+stage2
combining in the same way. (stage2 wins). Patch 1 turns PBHA on for stage2,
where KVM only generates the safe default value. This stops KVM guests from
using PBHA on Cortex cores. It should be harmless for any core that does not
behave like this.


The remaining patches allow firmware to describe which PBHA bits only affect
performance, and which have dangerous side effects like encryption or other
forms of corruption, that would mean the OS has to ensure all aliases are
removed.

The lists exist to allow an OS to avoid the cost of rewriting aliases when that
isn't necessary, and for KVM to determine which bits it can enable for a guest:
KVM uses the 'performance only' list to try and enable the corresponding bits
for KVM guests - but only if they can't be used to generate a value not in the
list.
This depends on knowing the CPU implements the 'stage2 wins' behaviour. I've
listed the CPUs whose TRMs describe this behaviour, and asked for other TRMs to
be updated to say what the behaviour is.

A pgprot_pbha() helper is added to allow drivers to request the 'performance
only' kind of PBHA bit for a mapping.


Supporting the 'no aliases' kind is much more involved. I've not tried to do
this. (do we need to?)

I don't have a platform that uses any of this, so I can't detect whether or not
the PBHA values were generated with the read/writes.
