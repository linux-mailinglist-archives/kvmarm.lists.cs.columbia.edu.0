I have started doing that for the NV series [1], as our virtual CPU is 
much
more limited than the HW it runs on. It shouldn't be hard to turn this 
into
something more generic.

However, it doesn't say anything about the traps that can occur as the
architecture grows new extensions. The current position is to always
inject an UNDEF (exactly what James is doing here), but it isn't obvious
to me that it is always the right thing to do. We should probably drop 
the
dmesg screaming and convert it to a trace...

I doubt it is. The number of additions up to ARMv8.6 is huge, and 
someone
would need to carefully comb it and test it on FVP with all the possible
architectural knobs turned in various ways...

Thanks,

         M.
