Yeah, you are right.

If that happens, we won't try to use block mapping for memslot with VM_PFNMAP.
But it keeps a same logic with old code.

1. When without dirty-logging, we won't try block mapping for it, and we'll
finally know that it's device, so won't try to do adjust THP (Transparent Huge Page)
for it.
2. If userspace wrongly enables dirty logging for this memslot, we'll force_pte for it.

Thanks,
Keqian
