/facepalm

Thought I had done this already. Re-requested to join kvmarm@. Seems
that gmail politely decided the mailing list was spam, so no
confirmation email came through.

Very true. At least on x86, there's a fair bit of plumbing to handle
the KVM-owned L0 offset reg and the guest-owned L1 offset reg.

Agreed. I would have preferred a VM-wide ioctl to do this, but since
x86 explicitly allows for drifted TSCs that can't be the case in a
generic ioctl. I can do the same broadcasting as we do in the case of
a VMM write to CNTVCT_EL0.

Pssh. My ioctl numbers aren't _too_ close to the limit ;-)

Yeah, it'd be good to do it w/o adding new plumbing. The only reason
I'd considered it is because x86 might necessitate it. Not wanting to
apply bad convention to other arches, but keeping at least a somewhat
consistent UAPI would be nice.

Indeed, we do have the risk of time going backwards, but I'd say that
the VMM shares in the responsibility to provide a consistent view of
the counter too.

Here's how I envisioned it working:

Record the time, cycles, and offset (T0, C0, Off0) when saving the
counter state. Record time and cycles (T1, C1) again when trying to
restore counter state. Compute the new offset:

Off1 = Off0 - (T1-T0) * CNTFRQ - (C0 - C1).

The primary concern here is idempotence. Once Off1 is calculated, it
doesn't matter how much time elapses between the calculation and the
call into KVM, it will always produce the intended result. If instead
we restore the counters by-value (whilst trying to account for elapsed
time), my impression is that we'd do the following: Record time and
guest counter (T0, G0) when saving counter state. Record time again
when trying to restore counter state.

In userspace, compute the time elapsed and fold it into the guest counter (G1):

G1 = G0 + (T1-T0) * CNTFRQ

And then in the kernel:

CNTVOFF = G1 - CNTPCT

Any number of things can happen in between the kernel and userspace
portions of this operation, causing some drift of the VM's counter.
Fundamentally I suppose the issue we have is that we sample the host
counter twice (T1, G1), when really we'd want to only do so once.

So, open to any suggestions where we avoid the issue of causing the
guest counter to drift, offsets only seemed to be the easiest thing
given that they ought to be constant for the lifetime of a VM on a
host and is the backing state used by hardware.
