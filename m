I think you're being polite calling this a 'nit' :-)

Naming came about lazily to shorten some names, but completely breaks
the notion of what a trap is. Oops.

We need to come to agreement on what degree of mix-and-match should be
supported.

Spectre really ought to be in the kernel, and I don't think anyone is
particularly excited about reimplementing PSCI. Right now my interest
in this starts and ends with forwarding the vendor-specific hypercall
range to userspace, allowing something like Hyper-V PV on KVM.

The goal of what I was trying to get at is that either the kernel or
userspace takes ownership of a range that has an ABI, but not both. i.e.
you really wouldn't want some VMM or cloud provider trapping portions of
KVM's vendor-specific range while still reporting a 'vanilla' ABI at the
time of discovery. Same goes for PSCI, TRNG, etc.

Right, we'll need a more robust data structure for all this.

My only concern is that communicating the hypercall filter between
user/kernel with a set of ranges or function numbers is that we could be
mutating what KVM *doesn't* already implement into an ABI of sorts.

i.e. suppose that userspace wants to filter function(s) in an
unallocated/unused range of function numbers. Later down the line KVM
adds support for a new shiny thing and the filter becomes a subset of a
now allocated range of calls. We then reject the filter due to the
incongruence.

I can drop this bit for now, always easy to add it back in and advertize
with a flag if the overhead is too great.
