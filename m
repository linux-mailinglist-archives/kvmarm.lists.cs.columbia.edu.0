Are these faults actually recoverable? My memory is a bit hazy here, but I
thought SPE buffer data could be written out in whacky ways such that even
a bog-standard page fault could result in uncoverable data loss (i.e. DL=1),
and so pinning is the only game in town.

A funkier approach might be to defer pinning of the buffer until the SPE is
enabled and avoid pinning all of VM memory that way, although I can't
immediately tell how flexible the architecture is in allowing you to cache
the base/limit values.
