Ah, sure I can do that.  I had thought this being in the FP last state
structure made things clear here.

My experience trying to follow and update this code has been that
layering on more helpers just shifts the potential for bugs around -
it's easy to have the calling context using the wrong helper and looking
correct, or to spend time cross checking if the helper in a particular
context is the right one.  Sometimes this happens because something
about the calling context changed rather than due to writing a new use.
Yes, someone might forget to update the state type but my experience
with this code is that it's a lot easier to spot "this is writing new
state, did it update the state type?" than "this is writing new state,
did it call the helper that implicitly updates the state type or the
other one?".

Since these callers are already explicitly peering into the data in one
form or another (like reading or writing the actual register values, and
including for some checking the type information) it seems reasonable
for them to also be doing updates to the type selection explicitly.  It
does also make the error handling a little neater, if we are switching
between state types then in the case of error we just leave things using
the old, unmodified state.
