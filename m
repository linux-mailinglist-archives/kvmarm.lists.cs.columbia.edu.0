Please! I turned off my last x86 development machine over the weekend,
and my x86 laptop is now a glorified window manager... ;-)

Yup. Hopefully we won't have to wait for too long to see this stuff (I
had good discussions on the subject at both KF and Plumbers in Dublin
earlier this year).

I don't disagree with that: for vcpu-based workloads, the rings are
great and doing their job. It's just that there is another side to
this problem, and you'll have to deal with both eventually. We're just
ahead of the curve here...
