This series is a revival of an RFC series sent in Dec 2016 [1].
Given the amount of code and the lack of traction at that time,
I haven't respinned until now. However a recent bug found related
to the ITS migration convinced me that this work may deserve to be
respinned and enhanced.

Tests exercise main ITS commands and also test migration.
With the migration framework, we are able to trigger the
migration from guest and that is very practical actually.

What is particular with the ITS programming is that most of
the commands are passed through queues and there is real error
handling. Invalid commands are just ignored and that is not
really tester friendly.

The series can be fount at:

Best Regards

Eric

History:
v4 -> v5:
- 32b stubs moved back to arm/gic.c
- some changes reordering
- minor style issues

v3 -> v4:
- addressed comments from Drew and Zenghui
- added "page_alloc: Introduce get_order()"
- removed "arm: gic: Provide per-IRQ helper functions"
- ITS files moved to lib64
- and many more, see individual logs

v2 -> v3:
- fix 32b compilation
- take into account Drew's comments (see individual diff logs)

v1 -> v2:
- took into account Zenghui's comments
- collect R-b's from Thomas

Execution:
x For other ITS tests:
  ./run_tests.sh -g its

x non migration tests can be launched invidually. For instance:
  ./arm-run arm/gic.flat -smp 8 -append 'its-trigger'
