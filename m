In general there's another case

	(d) loaded with some unrelated user task's state

I have a vague memory that the hyp trap code is supposed to save state
back to whatever task it belonged to -- but functions like
kvm_arch_vcpu_run_map_fp() make me suspicious that if this can happen,
it doesn't work correctly.

Since you're digging anyway, I'll answer in the form of a question:
when we reach __hyp_handle_fpsimd(), can the state in the FPSIMD/SVE
regs be unsaved data belonging to another task?  I'd hope not, because
fpsimd_thread_switch() should have saved any dirty regs when scheduling
that other thread out.

If the regs can't be owned by another task, then there may be some scope
for simplifying the code along the lines you suggest...

Er, me too.  It's a while since I worked on this ;)

I'm wondering whether the original code is buggy here.

If the FPSIMD/SVE regs contain some other task's data, we'd overwrite
current's regs with that data when running __hyp_handle_fpsimd().

Maybe we should have been checking TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE here.  If the
issue can happen, your version may fix it.

If we wanted to keep the separate flag (see below for some rationale),
it might make sense to do:

  	vcpu->arch.flags &= ~(KVM_ARM64_FP_ENABLED |
  			      KVM_ARM64_HOST_SVE_IN_USE |
  			      KVM_ARM64_HOST_SVE_ENABLED |
			      KVM_ARM64_FP_HOST);
	if (!test_thread_flag(TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE))
		vcpu->arch.flags |= KVM_ARM64_FP_HOST;

[...]

Without this, there is no record that we did anything.  Are you sure we
can't save junk data into the host context the next time we take this
trap?  Will we re-enable the trap unnecessarily?


I think previously I was trying to avoid things like
test_and_clear_thread_flag() here because there were limitations on what
we could call from the hyp code.  Maybe that's not such an issue now.

I'm slightly uneasy about setting TIF_FOREIGN_FPSTATE from the hyp
switch code however.  The order in which this flag is touched with
respect to other metadata is important in preemptible code, so I
preferred to avoid bare writing of this thread flag: rather it should
be set and cleared through the fpsimd_bind_*() and fpsimd_flush_*()
functions if at all possible, but these didn't seem suitable for calling
from hyp at the time.

In the hyp code we are of course not preemptible, so we would probably
get away with a bare set_thread_flag() in practice.

Overall, it felt a bit cleaner to have separate metdata for the hyp
code, and sync it with the host's metadata in clearly defined places
(the functions in arch/arm64/kvm/fpsimd.c).  KVM_ARM64_FP_HOST plays
that role for the hyp code at present.

That doesn't mean I wouldn't welcome a simplification, though!

Cheers
