Is it a must that arm64 needs to track device DMAs using the same dirty
tracking interface rather than VFIO or any other interface?  It's
definitely not the case for x86, but if it's true for arm64, then could the
DMA be spread across all the guest pages?  If it's also true, I really
don't know how this will work..

We're only syncing the dirty bitmap once right now with the protocol.  If
that can cover most of the guest mem, it's same as non-live.  If we sync it
periodically, then it's the same as enabling dirty-log alone and the rings
are useless.

I think I can get your point on why you're not happy with the document, but
IMHO how we document is one thing, how it'll work is another.  I preferred
explicit documentation because it'll help the app developer to support the
interface, also more docs to reference in the future; no strong opinion,
though.

However if there's fundamental statement that was literally wrong, then
it's another thing, and we may need to rethink.

Thanks,
