It appears that when a guest traps into KVM because it is
performing a CMO on a Read Only memslot, our handling of
this operation is "slightly suboptimal", as we treat it as
an MMIO access without a valid syndrome.

The chances that userspace is adequately equiped to deal
with such an exception being slim, it would be better to
handle it in the kernel.

What we need to provide is roughly as follows:

(a) if a CMO hits writeable memory, handle it as a normal memory acess
(b) if a CMO hits non-memory, skip it
(c) if a CMO hits R/O memory, that's where things become fun:
  (1) if the CMO is DC IVAC, the architecture says this should result
      in a permission fault
  (2) if the CMO is DC CIVAC, it should work similarly to (a)

We already perform (a) and (b) correctly, but (c) is a total mess.
Hence we need to distinguish between IVAC (c.1) and CIVAC (c.2).

One way to do it is to treat CMOs generating a translation fault as
a *read*, even when they are on a RW memslot. This allows us to
further triage things:

If they come back with a permission fault, that is because this is
a DC IVAC instruction:
- inside a RW memslot: no problem, treat it as a write (a)(c.2)
- inside a RO memslot: inject a data abort in the guest (c.1)

The only drawback is that DC IVAC on a yet unmapped page faults
twice: one for the initial translation fault that result in a RO
mapping, and once for the permission fault. I think we can live with
that.

Notes:
    I have taken the option to inject an abort in the guest when
    it issues a DC IVAC on a R/O memslot, but another option would
    be to just perform the invalidation ourselves as a DC CIAVAC.
    
    This would have the advantage of being consistent with what we
    do for emulated MMIO.
