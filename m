That fixes it halfway, but the AArch64 views of the AArch32 feature
registers have meaning even if AArch32 is defined at EL0. The only time
they are architecturally UNKNOWN is if AArch32 is not implemented at any
EL visible to the guest.

So, given that:

I completely agree that there is a large set of things that can be swept
under the rug of userspace bugs. If we are going to do that, we need to
strongly assert that configurable feature registers is only for fully
AArch64-only guests. Additionally, strong documentation around these
expectations is required.

Mind you, these opinions are my own and IDK how others or Marc feel
about it. My read of the situation w.r.t. the AArch32 registers is that
it will become a mess to implement on top of the AArch64 registers.
Given the fact that we aren't breaking AArch32 VMs, only augmenting
behavior for AArch64, it seems OK.

But I would genuinely love to be wrong on this topic too. I just don't
have perspective on AArch32 users so it is hard to really say whether
this is something they need as well.
