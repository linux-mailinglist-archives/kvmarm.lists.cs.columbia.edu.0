How do you reconcile this with the need to have a single kernel image 
that
is full-featured on all architecture revisions? In your view of the 
world,
it is OK to have a VHE-specific kernel that won't have KVM on a v8.0 
system.
 From my point of view, this simply isn't acceptable.

The goal is certainly commendable.

But pretending that KVM is fully independent from the rest of the 
kernel is
an intellectual fallacy. Most of the issues that affect KVM at any 
given time
are actually core kernel issues that cannot be solved by just updating 
the
KVM module. You need to update the whole thing, not just the tiny bit 
that
switches between host and guests.
