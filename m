Although, even though the first overflow is timed correctly, the value
the guest reads may be wrong...

Assuming a Linux guest with the arm_pmu.c driver, if I recall correctly
this writes the -remainingperiod to the counter upon stopping/starting.
In the case of a perf_event that is pinned to a task, this will happen
upon every context switch of that task. If the counter was getting close
to overflow before the context switch, then the value written to the
guest counter will be very high and thus the sample_period written in KVM
will be very low...

The best scenario is when the host handles the overflow, the guest
handles its overflow and rewrites the guest counter (resulting in a new
host perf_event) - all before the first host perf_event fires again. This
is clearly the assumption the code makes.

Or - the host handles its overflow and kicks the guest, but the guest
doesn't respond in time, so we end up endlessly and pointlessly kicking it
for each host overflow - thus resulting in the large difference between number
of interrupts between host and guest. This isn't ideal, because when the
guest does read its counter, the value isn't correct (because it overflowed
a zillion times at a value less than the arrchitected max).

Worse still is when the sample_period is so small, the host doesn't
even keep up.

This seems a reasonable pragmatic approach - though of course you will end
up counting slightly slower due to the host interrupt latency. But that's
better than the status quo.

It may be possible with perf to have a single-fire counter (this mitigates
against my third scenario but you still end up with a loss of precision) -
See PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH.

Ideally the PERF_EVENT_IOC_REFRESH type of functionality could be updated
to reload to a different value after the first hit.

This problem also exists on arch/x86/kvm/pmu.c (though I'm not sure what
their PMU drivers do with respect to the value they write).

This is correct, because in this case we *do* care about _PMCR_LC.

I'm not sure about the above line - does direct manipulation of sample_period
work on a running perf event? As far as I can tell this is already done in the
kernel with __perf_event_period - however this also does other stuff (such as
disable and re-enable the event).
