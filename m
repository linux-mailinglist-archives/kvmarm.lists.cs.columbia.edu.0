Thanks for including me Marc. I think you've mentioned all the examples
of why we don't generally expect N+1 -> N migrations to work that I
can think of. While some of the examples like get-reg-list could
eventually be eliminated if we had CPU models to tighten our machine type
state, I think N+1 -> N migrations will always be best effort at most.

I agree with giving userspace control over the exposer of the hypercalls
though. Using pseudo-registers for that purpose rather than a pile of
CAPs also seems reasonable to me.

And, while I don't think this patch is going to proceed, I thought I'd
point out that the opt-out approach doesn't help much with expanding
our migration support unless we require the VMM to be upgraded first.
And, even then, the (N_kern, N+1_vmm) -> (N+1_kern, N_vmm) case won't
work as expected, since the source enforce opt-out, but the destination
won't. Also, since the VMM doesn't key off the kernel version, for the
most part N+1 VMMs won't know when they're supposed to opt-out or not,
leaving it to the user to ensure they consider everything. opt-in
usually only needs the user to consider what machine type they want to
launch.

Thanks,
drew
