But that's the sticking point for me. IIUC, we're going to deliver an
aync PF SDEI event to the PE that is waiting on a page so it can go do
something else and wait for the page to come in. Normal events preempt
~everything, critical events preempt even normal events.

How can the guest context switch and do something better at an arbitrary
instruction boundary (such as in an SDEI handler of normal priority)? If
a guest takes a page fault in that context, it may as well wait
synchronously for the page to come in.

And in the case of the page ready event, we still need to clean up shop
before switching to the unblocked context.

I believe there are multiple use cases for guest-initiated SDEI events
beyond just testing. Poking a hung PE but one example.

But then we're sprinkling a lot of dead code throughout KVM, right? It
makes KVM's job even easier if it doesn't have to worry about nesting
SDEI events.

Isn't there always going to be some piece of software that raises an
event?

For KVM, we have guest-initiated 'software-signaled' events and KVM-initiated
async PF (whatever else may follow as well).

What if we use some other plumbing to indicate the state of the vCPU? MP
state comes to mind, for example.

The guest ABI w.r.t. SDEI is under full ownership of KVM. Any other
implementations events will never get exposed to the guest.

Couldn't the guest own the host if it was talking to our firmware
anyway?

What I'm saying is, can't the caller of kvm_sdei_is_sw_signaled() just
do the comparison?
