Since some features are not binary in nature (e.g. AA64DFR0_EL1.BRPs
fields indicate number of breakpoints minus 1), using
kvm_vcpu_init->features to configure such features is inconvenient.

One of the reasons why we want the finer grained control is that
we want to expose a uniform set/level of features for a group of
guests on systems with different ARM CPUs.

I will update the cover letter.

Thanks,
Reiji
