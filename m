Slower than the guest should expect. Assuming a cycle counter (with LC) is
initially programmed to 0, you'd target a guest interrupt period of 2^64 x cycle
period...

But I'm wrong in saying that you end up counting slightly slower - as you're
not restarting the perf counter or changing the value so there should be no change
in the interrupt period to the guest.

I was considering the case where the kernel perf event is recreated in the
overflow handler, in which case unless you consider the time elapsed between the
event firing and changing the sample_period then you end up with a larger period.

The mechanism to change the value of event->event_limit is only available via
ioctl, though I was implying that an in-kernel mechansim could be provided.
This would be trivial. (But it doesn't help, as I don't think you could create
another perf kernel event in that context).

I suspect this is working lazily - when you want to change the underlying pmu
period, you need to write the new period to the host PMU counters. This is done
in armpmu_start. __perf_event_period would normally stop and then start the
PMU to achieve this (hence the PERF_EF_RELOAD flag). Your code doesn't do this.

However, the perf counter set up in KVM is always pinned to the guest process
and thus when switching to/from this task the counter are stopped and started.
Therefore I suspect the sample_period you change goes into effect at this point
in time. So it probably stops going crazy - but not immediately.

I think the underlying counter also gets reset to the new period just before it
calls perf_event_overflow (see armv8pmu_handle_irq) - so worse case you'll wait
until it overflows for the second time.

In any case this is still better than the status quo.
