Ok. What about implementations that supports only stage 2? Do we
need a private VMID allocator for those or can use the same common
KVM VMID allocator?

Sure.

Yes. I have observed this with my current implementation. I have a check
to see the private S2 config VMID belongs to the same domain s2_cfg, then
skip the live update to the STE VMID.

Ok. That helps.
