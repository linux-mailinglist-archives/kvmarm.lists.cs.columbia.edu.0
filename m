Thanks for having given this a go.

However, without more details, it is pretty hard to find out what you 
have tested.
What sort of guest have you booted, with what configuration, what 
workloads did you
run in the L2 guests and what are the architectural features that TX3 
implements?

The last point is specially important, as the NV architecture spans two 
major
revisions of the architecture and affects tons of other extensions that 
are
themselves optional. Without any detail on that front, I have no idea 
what the
coverage of your testing is.

Thanks,

         M.
