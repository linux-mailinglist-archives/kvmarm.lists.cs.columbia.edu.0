Well, the MMIO prototype we are going to use is void anyway, so it's
just one patch earlier that we get this new behaviour.
For handling MMIO errors:
- Hardware MMIO doesn't have a back channel: if the MMIO write triggers
  some error condition, the device would need to deal with it (setting
  internal error state, ignore, etc.). On some systems the device could
  throw some kind of bus error or SError, but this is a rather drastic
  measure, and is certainly not exercised by those ancient devices.
- Any kind of error reporting which can be triggered by a guest is
  frowned upon: it could spam the console or some log file, and so
  impact host operation. At the end an administrator can't do much about
  it, anyway.
- Which leaves the only use to some kvmtool developer debugging some
  device emulation or investigating weird guest behaviour. And in this
  case we can more easily have a debug message *inside* the device
  emulation code, can't we?

And since the MMIO handler prototype is void, we have no choice anyway,
at least not without another huge (and pointless) series to change
those user as well ;-)

Cheers,
Andre
