I think it's important to in some way ensure that the desire that this
is a single write is shown. copy_to_user() is effectively
"setup();memcpy();finish();" and while a good memcpy() implementation
would be identical to put_user() there's a lot more room for this being
broken in the future by changes to the memcpy() implementation. (And I
don't want to require that memcpy() has to detect this case).

One suggestion is to call it something like kvm_put_guest_atomic() to
reflect the atomicity requirement. Presumably that would be based on a
new put_user_atomic() which architectures could override as necessary if
put_user() doesn't provide the necessary guarantees.
