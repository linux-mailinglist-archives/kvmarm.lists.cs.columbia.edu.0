Nope, the other way around.. The point I was trying to make is that
clearing the active_vmids definitely have an impact in 16-bit vmid
case, where rollover is not happening, as it ends up taking the slow
path more frequently.

Test setup-1, case 2(with active_vmids clear): Around 4.8% more time
to finish the test compared to vanilla kernel.

Test setup-1, case 3(Without clear): 0.15% more time compared to
vanilla kernel.

For the 4-bit vmid case, the impact of clearing vmids is not that obvious
probably because we have more rollovers.

Test setup-2, case 2(with active_vmids clear):0.8% less time compared to vanilla.
Test setup-2, case 3(Without clear): 1.05% less time compared to vanilla kernel.
 
So between the two(with and without clearing the active_vmids), the "without" 
one has better numbers for both Test setups.

> Why would the active_asid clear have any impact on the number of exits?

In 16 bit vmid case, it looks like the no. of exits is considerably lower if we clear
active_vmids. . Not sure it is because of the frequent slow path or not. But anyway,
the time to finish the test is higher.

Ok. The idea of running the 4-bit test setup was to capture that. It doesn't
look like it has a major impact when compared to the original kernel. May be
I should take an average of more test runs. Please let me know if there is a 
better way to measure that impact.

Hope, I am clear.

Thanks,
Shameer
