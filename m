I think the SC2A11 SoC used in the Socionext developerbox counts as
"broken":

https://www.96boards.org/documentation/enterprise/developerbox/support/known-issues.html

I'm not sure my understanding of the issue is 100% correct, but I
believe the firmware workaround described there uses the stage 2
translation tables to map "Normal NC" onto "Device nGRE" or something
even more restricted.  Now this hardware may be classified as simply
broken.  However...

On hardware based on the NXP LX2160A SoC we're seeing some weird
behaviour when using "Normal NC" mappings with an AMD GPU that
disappear by using "Device nGnRnE" mappings on OpenBSD.  No such issue
was observed with hardware based on an Ampere eMAG SoC.  I don't fully
understand this issue yet, and it may very well be a bug in OpenBSD
code, but it does show there are potential pitfalls with using "Normal
NC" for mapping prefetchable BARs of PCIe devices.

On x86 WC:

1. Is not cached (but stores are buffered).

2. Allows unaligned access just like normal memory.

3. Allows speculative reads.

4. Has weaker ordering than normal memory; [lsm]fence instructions are
   needed to guarantee a particular ordering of writes with respect to
   other writes and reads.

5. Stores are buffered.  This buffer isn't snooped so it has to be
   flushed before changes are globally visible.  The [sm]fence
   instructions flush the store buffer.

6. The store buffer may combine multiple writes into a single write.

Now whether the fact the unaligned access is allowed is really part of
the semantics of WC mappings is debatable as x86 always allows
unaligned access, even for areas mapped with ioremap().

However, this is where userland comes in.  The userland graphics stack
does assume that graphics memory mapped throug a prefetchable PCIe BAR
allows unaligned access if the architecture allows unaligned access
for cacheable memory.  On arm64 this means that such memory needs to
be "Normal NC".  And since kernel drivers tend to map such memory
using ioremap_wc() that pretty much implies ioremap_wc() shoul use
"Normal NC" as well isn't it?
