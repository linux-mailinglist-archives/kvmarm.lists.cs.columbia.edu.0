Right, this is what I had in mind. This encodes the
'handler-unregister-pending' state.

Regardless of whether userspace actually manipulates the registers we
should still reject unsupported values. For example:

Let's say the VM is started on a kernel that introduced yet another SDEI
widget outside of your series. The VM was migrated back to an older
kernel w/o the SDEI widget, and as such the VMM attempts to set the
widget bit. Since the old kernel doesn't know what to do with the value
it should return EINVAL to userspace.
