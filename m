Thanks for the information, Marc. I've gone ahead and merged the tests.
What's the worst than can happen :-)  Anyway, I agree that when the tests
start failing in CIs, then they're doing their job. If your pending series
can't be applied right away, then the CIs can likely be taught to
temporarily ignore the known failures.

Thanks,
