I'll leave that for the compiler to figure out :)

Hmm, we're pulling the start_level right out of the vtcr, so I don't see
how it can be wrong. In your example, a start_level of 2 seems correct to
me, as we'll translate 13 bits there, then 13 bits at level 3 which covers
the 24 bits you need (with a 16-bit offset within the page).

Your suggestion would give us a start_level of 1, which has a redundant
level of translation. Maybe you're looking at the levels upside-down? The
top level is level 0 and each time you walk to a new level, that number
increases.

But perhaps I'm missing something. Please could you elaborate if you think
there's a problem here?

What's wrong with the existing check? In particular, I think we _want_
to support data->end == limit (it's exclusive). If data->addr == limit,
then we'll have a size of zero and the loop won't run.
