Yup, I've been thinking on the rest of the series just to make sure the
feedback I give is sane.

Right, but this still requires that we go back and update this switch
statement every time we add a new PSCI call, which is exactly what I was
hoping we could avoid. Doing this based exactly on the spec reduces the
burden for future changes, and keeps all relevant context in a single
spot.

  #define SMCCC_STD_PSCI_RANGE_START	0x0000
  #define SMCCC_STD_PSCI_RANGE_END	0x001f
  #define SMCCC_STD_TRNG_RANGE_START	0x0050
  #define SMCCC_STD_TRNG_RANGE_END	0x005f

  switch (ARM_SMCCC_FUNC_NUM(function_id)) {
          case SMCCC_STD_PSCI_RANGE_START ... SMCCC_STD_PSCI_RANGE_END:
	          return kvm_psci_call(vcpu);
          case SMCCC_STD_TRNG_RANGE_START ... SMCCC_STD_TRNG_RANGE_END:
	  	  return kvm_trng_call(vcpu);

	 ...
  }

[...]

I think this makes it much more confusing for the reader, as you'd be
hard pressed to find these function IDs in the SMCCC spec. Since their
values are outside of the specification, it is confusing to only address
them after these switch statements have decided that they belong to a
particular service owner as they do not.
