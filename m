This bug is present in the commit you are mentioning, and from what I can tell
it's also present in the commit it's fixing (d5a21bcc2995 ("KVM: arm64: Move
common VHE/non-VHE trap config in separate functions")) - vcpu->arch.mdcr_el2 is
computed in kvm_arm_setup_debug(), which is called after vcpu_load(). My guess is
that this bug is from VHE support was added (or soon after).

I can dig further, how far back in time should I aim for?

kvm_arm_setup_debug() is called with preemption disabled, and it can use
__this_cpu_read(). kvm_arm_vcpu_init_debug() is called with preemption enabled, so
it must use this_cpu_read(). I wanted to make the distinction because
kvm_arm_setup_debug() is in the run loop.

I can remove the wrapper and have kvm_arm_setup_mdcr_el2() use this_cpu_read() for
the host's mdcr_el2 value at the cost of a preempt disable/enable in the run loop
when preemption is disabled. If you think that would make the code easier to
follow, I can certainly do that.

I'm sorry, but I don't understand what you mean. This is my understanding of what
is happening.

Without this patch, trap_debug is set to true and the KVM_ARM64_DEBUG_DIRTY flag
is set if vcpu->guest_debug & KVM_GUESTDBG_USE_HW. Further down, trap debug is
only used when computing mdcr_el2.

With this patch, trap_debug is set to true if vcpu->guest_debug &
KVM_GUESTDBG_USE_HW and it's also used for computing mdcr_el2, but this happens in
kvm_arm_setup_mdcr_el2(), which is called at the start of kvm_arm_setup_debug().
The KVM_ARM_DEBUG_DIRTY flags is still set in kvm_arm_setup_debug() if
vcpu->guest_debug & KVM_GUESTDBG_USE_HW, like before.

The guest never runs with the value computed in kvm_vcpu_first_run_init() unless
it's identical with the value recomputed in kvm_arm_setup_debug().

The only difference I see is that mdcr_el2 is computed at the start of
kvm_arm_setup_debug(). I get the feeling I'm also missing something.

Thanks,

Alex
