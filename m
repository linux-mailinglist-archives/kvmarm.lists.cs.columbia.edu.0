Wouldn't having a per-pool max order help with that?

Comments would definitely help, but perhaps even having a simple function to
do the coalescing, which you could call from the loop body and which would
deal with marking the tail pages as HYP_NO_ORDER?

Just feels a bit backwards having __find_buddy() take an order parameter,
yet then return a page of the wrong order! __hyp_extract_page() always
passes the p->order as the order, so I think it would be worth having a
separate function that just takes the pool and the page for that.
