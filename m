As David has already replied - KVM uses MMU notifiers, so there's not 
really a good place to intercept this before the fault.

KVM already has a kvm_is_device_pfn(), and yes I agree restricting the 
MTE checks to only !kvm_is_device_pfn() makes sense (I have the fix in 
my branch locally).

Indeed, it'll be interesting to see whether people want to build MTE 
capable systems with significant quantities of non-MTE capable memory. 
But for a first stage let's stick with either all guest memory (except 
devices) is MTE or you disable MTE for the guest.

My initial thought was to free the metadata immediately. However it 
turns out that the following sequence can happen:

  1. Swap out a page
  2. Swap the page in *read only*
  3. Discard the page
  4. Swap the page in again

So there's no writing of the swap data again before (3). This works 
nicely with a swap device because after writing a page it stays there 
forever, so if you know it hasn't been modified it's pointless rewriting 
it. Sadly it's not quite so ideal with the MTE tags which are currently 
kept in RAM. Arguably it would make sense to modify the on-disk swap 
format to include the tags - but that would open a whole new can of worms!

swapoff needs to ensure that all the PTEs have been restored because 
after the swapoff has completed the PTEs will be pointing at a swap 
entry which is no longer valid (and could even have been reallocated to 
point to a new swap device). When you issue you a swapoff, Linux will 
scan the mmlist and the page tables of every process to search for swap 
entry PTEs relating to the swap which is being removed (see try_to_unuse()).
