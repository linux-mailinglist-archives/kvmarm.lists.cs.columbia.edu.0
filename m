Ah, yes I agree. Thinking about it more we will not need something
similar to KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID.

So then, for any register where userspace/KVM need to negotiate
features, the default value will return the maximum feature set that is
supported. If userspace wants to constrain features, read out the
register, make sure everything you want is there, and write it back
blowing away the superfluous bits. Given this should we enforce ordering
on feature registers, such that a VMM can only write to the registers
before a VM is started?

Also, Reiji is working on making the identity registers writable for the
sake of feature restriction. The suggested negotiation interface would
be applicable there too, IMO.

Many thanks to both you and Drew for working this out with me.
