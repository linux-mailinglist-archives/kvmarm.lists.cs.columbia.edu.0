Has this been measured?  Years ago when I messed with this, it was in
the noise as JSON parsing is really fast these days.

efficient where?  In the kernel?

That's interesting, do the varlink developers know this?  And we can say
"for the kernel int will be int64" and be done with it, so this
shouldn't be that big of an issue.

Do you care in advance?

units would be nice, I agree.

I don't think the kernel implementation needs this, you can just specify
the schema "on the fly" and it should work.  Or maybe I'm wrong, it's
been a few years.

Again, I didn't think this was an issue with the kernel implementation
in that the userspace side could determine the schema by the data coming
from the kernel, it wouldn't have to "know" about it ahead of time.

But I could be wrong.

It should be in some standard format.  I'm not wed to varlink, but I
thought it solved some of your issues here with userspace not knowing
the schema ahead of time which is the key as it will change over time
and the kernel should be 'self-describing'.

If not, and it sounds like you have looked into it, or at least the
userspace side, then that's fine.

But you should write up a justification somewhere why you didn't use an
existing format (what about the netlink format?) in at least the
changelog, like you did here.  As you will be stuck with this api for
the next 20+ years, it's good to be confident in it :)

maybe someday we can get varlink into the tree, as I still think it
would be better than the ad-hoc implementations we currently have.
