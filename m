I'm not sure that that can be accomplished right now. kvm-unit-tests
supports only qemu as an automated test runner, and qemu enables the PMU by
default. I don't know if it can be disabled, it would be nice if it could.
I stumbled upon this by mistake, when I ran kvmtool without enabling the
PMU (the default in kvmtool is to not have it enabled).

If it is possible to disable PMU emulation from the qemu's command line,
then it should be as simple as writing a test that expects all PMU register
accesses to trigger an undefined exception (and adding a new test
definition).

If it is not possible to do this with qemu, then we would have to wait
until kvm-unit-tests can use kvmtool as the test runner. I have an RFC sent
for that [1], I need to get back to it.

Another option would be to have this as a kselftest, although I don't know
how easy it is to register an exception handler in a kselftest. The test
could be further expanded to other registers gated by a VCPU feature being
set.

I was thinking you can simply use .visibility = pmu_visibility, like it's
done with the PMU_SYS_REG macro:

I've renamed AA32_ZEROHIGH -> AA32_DIRECT. Feel free to use the snippet as
you see fit (or not at all).
