This surely is the same as treating a VFIO device as memory and performing some
unsupported operation on it.

I thought the DT 'which memory ranges' description for MTE was removed. Wouldn't the rules
for a guest be the same? If you enable MTE, everything described as memory must support
MTE. Something like persistent memory then can't be described as memory, ... we have the
same problem on the host.

(indeed, stage2 is pretty lazy)

We don't. Memory slots take the VM-fd, whereas the easy-to-add feature bits are per-vcpu.
Packing features into the 'type' that create-vm takes is a problem once we run out,
although the existing user is the IPA space size, and MTE is a property of the memory system.


The meaning of the flag is then "I described this as memory, only let the guest access
memory through this range that is MTE capable". What do we do when that is violated? Tell
the VMM is the nicest, but its not something we ever expect to happen. I guess an abort is
what real hardware would do, (if firmware magically turned off MTE while it was in use).

This would need to be kvm's inject_abt64(), as otherwise the vcpu may take the stage2
fault again, forever. For kvm_set_spte_hva() we can't inject an abort (which vcpu?), so
not mapping the page and waiting for the guest to access it is the only option...


Thanks,

James
