The pages should not be accessed as normal memory so they do not have a
direct (or in ARMish linear) mapping and are never given to buddy. 
After looking at ACPI standard I don't see a fundamental reason for this
but they've already made this mess and we need to cope with it.

It does, but let's wait with /proc/iomem changes. We don't really have a
100% consistent view of it on different architectures, so adding yet
another type there does not seem, well, urgent.

I agree that there is a lot of commonality between NOMAP and reserved. The
problem is that even semantics for reserved is different between
architectures. Moreover, on the same architecture there could be
E820_TYPE_RESERVED and memblock.reserved with different properties.

I'd really prefer moving in baby steps here because any change in the boot
mm can bear several month of early hangs debugging ;-)
