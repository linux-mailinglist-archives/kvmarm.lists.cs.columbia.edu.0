I think I didn't make things clear. What I meant is VM_PFNMAP can't
be set for hugetlbfs VMAs. So the checks here can be simplified as
below if you agree:

     if (is_vm_hugetlb_page(vma))
         return huge_page_shift(hstate_vma(vma));

     if (!(vma->vm_flags & VM_PFNMAP))
         return PAGE_SHIFT;

     VM_BUG_ON(is_vm_hugetlb_page(vma));       /* Can be dropped */

Yeah, It's fine to keep this series as of being. There are 3 checks applied
here for MMIO region: hva/hpa/ipa and they're distributed in two functions,
making the code a bit hard to follow. I can post patch to simplify it after
your series gets merged :)

Thanks,
Gavin
