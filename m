Yes, you are right, when I read the MSR PMSNEVFR_EL1, <Xt> pseudocode I mis=
sed the
fact that for writes the trap is controlled by HDFG*W*TR_EL1, not by
HDFG*R*TR_EL1. I set=A0 the nPMSNEVFR_EL1 bit in HDFGWRTR_EL1, and Linux do=
esn't
hang anymore when I try to write to the register. Will send v2 shortly.

Thanks,

Alex
