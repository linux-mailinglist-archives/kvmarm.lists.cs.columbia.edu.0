Don't know, but that's my point.  Without a consumer in generic KVM and due to
my lack of arm64 knowledge, without a high-level description of how the flag will
be used by arm64, it's really difficult to determine what's safe and what's not.
For other architectures, it's an impossible question to answer because we don't
know how the flag might be used.

No.  An atomic_t is generally useful only if there are multiple writers that can
possibly write different values.  It's highly unlikely that simply switching to an
atomic address the needs of arm64.

Ya, valid_wakeup is an oddball, I don't know why it's in kvm_vcpu instead of
arch code that's wrapped with e.g. kvm_arch_vcpu_valid_wakeup().

That said, valid_wakeup is consumed by generic KVM, i.e. has well defined semantics
for how it is used, so it's purely a "this code is rather odd" issue.  vm_started
on the other hand is only produced by generic KVM, and so its required semantics are
unclear.
