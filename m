Thanks, I'll drop that check.

That's what I intended by "be able to see the page's tags", but I'll 
reword to be explicit about it being Normal Cacheable.

The only call sites of kvm_pgtable_stage2_map() are in mmu.c:

  * kvm_phys_addr_ioremap() - maps as device in stage 2

  * user_mem_abort() - handled above

  * kvm_set_spte_handler() - ultimately called from the .change_pte() 
callback of the MMU notifier

So the last one is potentially a problem. It's called via the MMU 
notifiers in the case of set_pte_at_notify(). The users of that are:

  * uprobe_write_opcode(): Allocates a new page and performs a 
copy_highpage() to copy the data to the new page (which with MTE 
includes the tags and will copy across the PG_mte_tagged flag).

  * write_protect_page() (KSM): Changes the permissions on the PTE but 
it's still the same page, so nothing to do regarding MTE.

  * replace_page() (KSM): If the page has MTE tags then the MTE version 
of memcmp_pages() will return false, so the only caller 
(try_to_merge_one_page()) will never call this on a page with tags.

  * wp_page_copy(): This one is more interesting - if we go down the 
cow_user_page() path with an old page then everything is safe (tags are 
copied over). The is_zero_pfn() case worries me a bit - a new page is 
allocated, but I can't instantly see anything to zero out the tags (and 
set PG_mte_tagged).

  * migrate_vma_insert_page(): I think migration should be safe as the 
tags should be copied.

So wp_page_copy() looks suspicious.

kvm_pgtable_stage2_map() looks like it could be a good place for the 
checks, it looks like it should work and is probably a more obvious 
place for the checks.

Given the changes to set_pte_at() which means that tags are restored 
from swap even if !PROT_MTE, the only race I can see remaining is the 
creation of new PROT_MTE mappings. As you mention an attempt to change 
mappings in the VMM memory space should involve a mmu notifier call 
which I think serialises this. So the remaining issue is doing this in a 
separate address space.

So I guess the potential problem is:

  * allocate memory MAP_SHARED but !PROT_MTE
  * fork()
  * VM causes a fault in parent address space
  * child does a mprotect(PROT_MTE)

With the last two potentially racing. Sadly I can't see a good way of 
handling that.
