It should ever be only written once, as MPIDR is a constant from the
guest perspective. So it is not that it can do nothing. It is just that
there should never be any other value written to it.

No, you're absolutely right.

Well spotted. I guess GFP_ATOMIC is in order.

Pointer auth registers definitely have a reset function, set to
reset_unknown. So does ACTLR_EL1, which resets to the host's value.

This looks like a (very minor) bug. reset_pmcr writes directly to the
PMCR_EL0 shadow register without using r->reg as the register number.
But in the light of the reset tracking we want to add, this needs
fixing.

Well, wait until I repost something a bit less buggy...

Thanks,
