I presume the use-case Keqian is looking at predates the necessary support in the CPU - Keqian if you can provide more details on the architecture(s) involved that would be helpful.

However I would argue that the most pragmatic approach would be to not support the combination of nested virt and LPT. Hopefully that can wait until the counter scaling support is available and not require PV.

Hi Marc and Steven,

In fact, I have realize a demo which utilize v8.6-ECV to present a constant timer freq to guest. It seems
work well, but this approach has some shortcoming:

1. Guest access to cntvct cntv_ctl cntv_tval cntv_cval must trap to EL2. Every trap will take about
   hundreds of nano-seconds. For every timer interrupt, there is about 5~6 traps, so it will spend
   several us (this seems not a serious problem :-) ). But trap will cause big deviation for nano-sleep.
2. We have to make cntfrq be a context of guest. However, only the highest exception level has right to
   modify cntfrq. It means we have to add a new SMC call.
3. cntkctl controls event stream freq, so KVM should also translate the guest access of cntkctl. However
   we cannot trap guest access of that. Any solution for this problem?

I think LPT as a software solution can solve these problems. However, as Marc said, UEFI knows nothing about
LPT, and it will access vtimer/counter directly. The key point is how serious the impact is on UEFI.

I can see that some UEFI runtime services and drivers/applications will access timer/counter.
For runtime services, it is OK. Because we can translate the result which return from UEFI for Linux.
For drivers/applications, they will feel time goes faster or slower after migration. This is a problem indeed :-)

Thanks,
Keqian
