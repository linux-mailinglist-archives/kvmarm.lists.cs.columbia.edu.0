What cpufeature knows is that consumers of the validation function
needs the validation of each field based on ID register schemes that
are described in Arm ARM (basically lower safe).
As lower values of PMUVER/DEBUGVER indicates lower level of features
or fewer level of features, those entries are to provide validation
based on that.  So, entries in arm64_ftr_bits_kvm_override will be added
to adjust cpufeture's behavior based on ID register schemes, and KVM may
or may not use them.

I need to remove the word "kvm" from variable/function/structure names
and put more clear comments:)

It's not impossible but it's a bit tricky (With __arm64_ftr_reg_valid(),
it might look straight forward, but I don't think that treats FTR_EXACT
correctly. Please see update_cpu_ftr_reg).

As I mentioned above, they aren't KVM specific.

Could you elaborate this a little more?

More specific concern I have about providing the override (with the
existing arm64_ftr_bits) would be when field values of arm64_ftr_bits
(i.e. LOWER_SAFE to EXACT) in cpufeature are changed due to kernel's
implementation reasons, which might affect KVM (may need to pass
extra override to arm64_ftr_reg_valid).
But, by having cpufeature provide the validation based on the ID
register schemes, cpufeature should be changed to provide the same
validation in that case (i.e. if DFR0.PERFMON is changed from LOWER_SAFE
to EXACT like AA64DFR0.PMUVER, DFR0.PERFMON should be added in
arm64_ftr_bits_kvm_override with LOWER_SAFE).

So, if I go with the option to provide override to cpufeature, IMHO it
would be preferable for cpufeature to provide the validation based
on ID schemes instead of with the current need-based policy (, which
might get changed) for clear separation.

What does "verbose cpufeature tables" mean ?

Userspace with configurable ID registers would eliminate such problems
on known systems, but I agree that KVM itself should prevent it.
It will be inconvenient for some people, but it would be safer in general.

Sure, I will improve that if I continue to keep the current way.
With the option of having a separate KVM's arm64_ftr_bits,
the code will be very different, but I will keep that in mind.
