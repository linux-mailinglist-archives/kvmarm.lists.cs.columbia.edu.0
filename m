I have reviewed the series and everything looks fine to me and ready to be merged.
I have also ran the following tests:

- On my x86_64 desktop, I ran a guest with --sdl, to exercise the vesa device.

- On a rockpro64, I ran kvm-unit-tests for arm64 and arm (kvmtool was compiled for
arm64); I also ran Linux guests using 4k and 64k pages with and without --force-pci.

- On a Seattle machine, I did PCI passthrough for an Intel 82574L network card and
ran Linux guests using 4k and 64k pages with and without --force-pci.

- On an odroid-c4 (4 x Cortex-A55), I ran Linux guests using 4k, 16k and 64k pages
with and without --force-pci.

With this series merged, everything will be in place to bring back the patch that
adds PCI Express 1.1 support for arm/arm64 [1]. The patch was previously dropped
because the RTC and UART were overlapping with the PCI I/O space and EDK2 doesn't
not understand PCI I/O bus addresses above 64k, but this series fixes that by
moving the addresses of the two devices.
