We've maintained stage2_pgd_addr_end() for the top-level iterator, but
it looks like we're failing to do the rounding in __kvm_pgtable_visit()
when hitting a leaf entry, so the caller (__kvm_pgtable_walk()) will
terminate early.

I agree that it's annoying, as you'd have expected us to run into this
earlier on.
