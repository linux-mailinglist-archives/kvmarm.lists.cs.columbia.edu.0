From what I can tell, the only asymmetry that can be exposed to a guest as
a result of the series is the number of events supported on a VCPU.

I don't like the idea of forcing userspace to set the *same* PMU for all
VCPUs, as that would severely limit running VMs with PMU on asymmetric
systems.

Even if KVM forces to set a PMU (does not have to be the same PMU) for all
VCPUs, that still does not look like the correct solution for me, because
userspace can set PMUs with different number of events.

What I can try is to make kvm->arch.pmuver the minimum version of all the
VCPU PMUs and the implict PMU. I'll give that a go in the next iteration.

Thanks,
Alex
