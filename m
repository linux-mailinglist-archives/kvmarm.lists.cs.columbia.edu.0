Yeah, I think we can drop the functionality to support the shared
event since both events are exposed by KVM as private events. Please
refer below reply for more details.

For @notifier, it is set on the kernel of source VM and migrated to the
kernel of destination VM. It's really concerned with security, I will
drop this in next respin.

I plan to make the following changes for next revision (v6) as below.
Please let me know if there are more things to be covered:

(1) Drop the code to support the shared (SDEI) events since the needed
     events, either software signaled or Async PF event, are all private.
     After that, the private event is the only type to be supported. When
     the shared event becomes unsupported, we can simply return SDEI_NOT_SUPPORTED
     for hypercall SDEI_EVENT_ROUTING_SET and SDEI_SHARED_RESET.

(2) Drop the code to support migration for now. It means the data
     structures defined in arch/arm64/include/uapi/asm/kvm_sdei_state.h
     will be combined to arch/arm64/include/asm/kvm_sdei.h. Besides,
     all the ioctl commands, including KVM_CAP_ARM_SDEI will be dropped
     either.

(3) As we discussed before, the linked lists will be replaced by the
     static arrays or preallocation. The data structures will be amended
     like below.

     (3.1) In arch/arm64/include/asm/kvm_sdei.h
  
     struct kvm_sdei_exposed_event {
         unsigned int                     num;
         unsigned char                    type;           /* reserved, should be 'private' */
         unsigned char                    signaled;
         unsigned char                    priority;
     };

     struct kvm_sdei_registered_event {
         struct kvm_sdei_exposed_event    *exposed_event;
         unsigned long                    ep_address;
         unsigned long                    ep_arg;
#define KVM_SDEI_EVENT_STATE_REGISTERED         (1UL << 0)
#define KVM_SDEI_EVENT_STATE_ENABLED            (1UL << 1)
#define KVM_SDEI_EVENT_STATE_UNREGISTER_PENDING (1UL << 2)
         unsigned long                    state;

         unsigned long                    event_count;  /* number of events pending for hanlding */
     };
        
     struct kvm_sdei_context {
         struct kvm_sdei_registered_event *registered_event;
         unsigned long                    regs[18];
         unsigned long                    pc;
         unsigned long                    pstate;
     };

     /* We even needn't a lock */
     struct kvm_sdei_vcpu {
         unsigned char                    masked;
         struct kvm_sdei_registered_event *registered_event;
         struct kvm_sdei_context          context[SDEI_EVENT_PRIORITY_CRITICAL + 1];
     };

     /* struct kvm_sdei won't be existing any more */

     (3.2) In arch/arm64/kvm/sdei.c

     static struct kvm_sdei_exposed_event exposed_events[] = {
         { .num      = SDEI_EVENT_SW_SIGNALED,    /* defined in include/uapi/linux/arm_sdei.h */
           .type     = SDEI_EVENT_TYPE_PRIVATE,
           .signaled = 1,
           .priority = SDEI_EVENT_PRIORITY_NORMAL,
         },
         {
           .num      = SDEI_EVENT_ASYNC_PF,       /* defined in include/asm/kvm_sdei.h */
           .type     = SDEI_EVENT_TYPE_PRIVATE,
           .signaled = 1,
           .priority = SDEI_EVENT_PRIORITY_CRITICAL,
         },
     };

     In kvm_sdei_create_vcpu(), the events are pre-allocated. They will be destroy
     in kvm_sdei_destroy_vcpu().
  
     struct kvm_vcpu_arch::sdei =
            kzalloc(sizeof(struct kvm_sdei_vcpu), GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT);
     struct kvm_sdei_vcpu::registered_event =
            kcalloc(sizeof(struct kvm_sdei_exposed_event), ARRAY_SIZE(exposed_events), GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT);

     In kvm_sdei_hypercall(), SDEI_NOT_SUPPORTED will be returned on hypercall
     SDEI_EVENT_ROUTING_SET and SDEI_SHARED_RESET.

(4) Stuff to be considered or discussed in future: migration and mechanism.
     We probably don't want to support the shared event. The function of a
     event is to notify from host to guest kernel. In this regard, the shared
     event can be replaced by the private one. With above changes in (1)/(2)/(3),
     we don't have any VM-scoped properties or states. It means all the properties
     and states are associated with VCPU. It will help to adopt 'firmware-pseudo'
     registers and KVM_{GET,SET}_ONE_REG during the migration in the future.

Yeah, I used "struct kvm_sdei_registered_event" to represent the shared and
private event. For the shared event, they are VM scoped. However, they're
VCPU scoped for the private event. As I suggested above, all the states are
VCPU scoped when the private event becomes the only supported one.

Thanks for the details about the 'firmware pseudo register'. Oliver, is
there exiting one in current KVM implementation? I would like to see how
it's being used. It's definitely a good idea. Those non-architectural
CPU properties can be mapped and migrated in a natural way. I'm not
sure if we had similar mechanism or 'firmware pseudo registers' for
the VM scoped properties?

Thanks,
Gavin
