Yes I've only played with kvmtool so far. 'basic support' at the moment
is little more than enabling the cap - that allows the guest to access
tags. However obviously aspects such as migration need to understand
what's going on to correctly save/restore tags - which is mostly only
relevant to Qemu.

Architecturally we don't (yet) have a way of describing memory without
tags, so indeed you will get all zeros if the guest hasn't populated the
tags yet.

As Catalin says, tags are no different from data so the VMM needs to
either pause the VM or mark the page read-only to protect it from guest
updates during the copy.

The whole test_bit/set_bit dance does seem to be leaving open race
conditions. I /think/ that Peter's extra flag as a lock with an added
memory barrier is sufficient to mitigate it, but at this stage I'm also
thinking some formal modelling would be wise as I don't trust my
intuition when it comes to memory barriers.

I'm not sure I see how atomically updating data+tags is different from
the existing issues around atomically updating the data. The VMM needs
to ensure that the guest doesn't see the page before all the data+all
the tags are written. It does mean lazy setting of the tags isn't
possible in the VMM, but I'm not sure that's a worthwhile thing anyway.
Perhaps I'm missing something?
