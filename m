Sure, I can add something here, but it sounds like you figured it out.

I can also add something here as the anchor thing is quite unusual. We
basically use it to mark an existing table entry which we want to replace
with a block entry, but before we can do that we have to descend into the
page table under that table entry freeing everything as we go. Then we'll
see the marked entry on the way back up and install the block entry then.

I had a few goes at implementing this with only LEAF and TABLE_POST but
it was really ugly, and actually it turns out TABLE_PRE is really useful
for debugging if you just want to print out the page-table.

Thanks. I'll post a v4 with some comments, so maybe that will help.

Hmm, but this is a two-line statement so I think it reads better.
