While I agree with the sentiment, the reality is pretty bleak.

I'm pretty sure nobody will ever run a migration on emulation. I also 
doubt
there is much overlap between MTE users and migration users, 
unfortunately.

No HW is available today, and when it becomes available, it will be in
the form of a closed system on which QEMU doesn't run, either because
we are locked out of EL2 (as usual), or because migration is not part of
the use case (like KVM on Android, for example).

So we can wait another two (five?) years until general purpose HW 
becomes
available, or we start merging what we can test today. I'm inclined to
do the latter.

And I think it is absolutely fine for QEMU to say "no MTE support with 
KVM"
(we can remove all userspace visibility, except for the capability).

         M.
