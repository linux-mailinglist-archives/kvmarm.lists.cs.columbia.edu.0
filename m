Hmm, so are you saying that with this patch applied, a machine where KVM
isn't even being used can no longer late-online CPUs without SPE if the boot
CPUs had it? If so, then I don't think that's acceptable, unfortunately.

As James points out, the current driver is very careful to support
big.LITTLE misconfigurations and I don't see why KVM support should change
that.
