On x86, the offsets for different vcpus are the same due to the logic at
kvm_synchronize_tsc function:

During guest vcpu creation, when the TSC-clock values are written
in a short window of time (or the clock value is zero), the code uses
the same TSC.

This logic is problematic (since "short window of time" is a heuristic 
which can fail), and is being replaced by writing the same offset
for each vCPU:

    KVM: x86: Expose TSC offset controls to userspace
    
    To date, VMM-directed TSC synchronization and migration has been a bit
    messy. KVM has some baked-in heuristics around TSC writes to infer if
    the VMM is attempting to synchronize. This is problematic, as it depends
    on host userspace writing to the guest's TSC within 1 second of the last
    write.
    
    A much cleaner approach to configuring the guest's views of the TSC is to
    simply migrate the TSC offset for every vCPU. Offsets are idempotent,
    and thus not subject to change depending on when the VMM actually
    reads/writes values from/to KVM. The VMM can then read the TSC once with
    KVM_GET_CLOCK to capture a (realtime, host_tsc) pair at the instant when
    the guest is paused.

So with that in place, the answer to 

How does userspace knows which vcpu to pick so
that it gets the right offset?

is any vcpu, since the offsets are the same.

If guest has access to the clock offset (between guest and host), then
in the guest:

	clockval = hostclockval - clockoffset

Adding "clockoffset" to that will retrieve the host clock.

Is that what you mean?
