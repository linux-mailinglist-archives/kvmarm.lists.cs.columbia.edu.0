The goal here isn't to protect the guest. It's already the case that
whatever the page contents are when the page is donated (from the
perspective of the KVM client), that's what the guest sees. That
applies to both data and (in non-protected VMs) tags.

The code that I added here is for solving a different problem, which
is to avoid exposing stale host state to the guest, which the KVM
client may not even be aware of. We sanitize pages before exposing
them in non-protected VMs for the same reason.

Right, I forgot about that. We probably only want to expose MTE to
guests if we have some indication (through the device tree or ACPI) of
how to protect the guest tag storage.

It sounds reasonable to land a basic set of features to begin with and
add MTE later. I'll develop my MTE-in-pKVM patch series as a followup
on top of this series.
