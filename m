In patch RFC, the numbers is got when memory pressure is 100G, so the number
is bigger here.

I am also not very clear about the difference. Maybe there is historic reason.

Before introducing DIRTY_LOG_INITIALLY_ALL_SET, all pages will be write
protected when starting dirty log, but only normal pages are needed
to be write protected again during dirty log sync, because huge pages will
be dissolved to normal pages.

For that x86 uses different routine to write protect huge pages and normal pages,
and arm64 uses same routine to do this, so arm64 still write protect all
pages again during dirty log sync, but x86 didn't.

So I think that x86 can write protect huge pages gradually too, just need to add
some code legs in dirty log sync.
