As far as I can tell, it is still valid (at least from the guest's
perspective). You could in practice use that to deal with level
interrupts, but we only inject the rising edge on this path, never
the falling edge. So effectively, this is limited to edge interrupts,
which is mostly MSIs.

Unless you are thinking of something else which I would have missed?

Thanks,

         M.
