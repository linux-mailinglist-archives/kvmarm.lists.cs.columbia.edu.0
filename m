Let me cast some light on this. The reason this started being
piggybacked on NR_PAGETABLE is that we had a remnant of an old
internal implementation of NR_PAGETABLE before it was introduced
upstream, that accounted KVM secondary page tables as normal page
tables. This made me think this behavior was preferable. Personally, I
wanted to make it a separate thing since the beginning. When I found
opinions here that also suggested a separate stat I went ahead for
that.

As for where to put this information, it does not have to be
NR_SECONDARY_PAGETABLE. Ultimately, people working on KVM are the ones
that will interpret and act upon this data, so if you have somewhere
else in mind please let me know, Sean.
