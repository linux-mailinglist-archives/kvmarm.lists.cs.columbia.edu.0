Bikeshed all you want :) But yeah, I like your suggestion.

Nope!

Ah, I didn't fully capture the reasoning about the batch size. I had
thought about batching by operating on at most 1 block of the largest
supported granularity, but that felt like an inefficient walk restarting
from root every 32M (for 16K paging).

OTOH, if/when we add support for larger blocks in S2 we will run into
the same exact problem if we batch on the largest block size. If
dirty logging caused the large blocks to be shattered down to leaf
granularity then we will visit a crazy amount of PTEs before releasing
the lock.

I guess what I'm getting at is we need to detect lock contention and the
need to reschedule in the middle of the walk instead of at some
predetermined boundary, though that ventures into the territory of 'TDP
MMU' features...

So, seems to me we can crack this a few ways:

  1.Batch at the arbitrary 1GB since it works currently and produces a
    more efficient walk for all page sizes. I can rework some of the
    logic in kvm_level_supports_block_mapping() such that we can
    BUILD_BUG_ON() if the largest block size exceeds 1GB. Kicks the can
    down the road on a better implementation.

  2.Batch by the largest supported block mapping size. This will result
    in less efficient walks for !4K page sizes and likely produce soft
    lockups when we support even larger blocks. Nonetheless, the
    implementation will remain correct regardless of block size.

  3.Test for lock contention and need_resched() in the middle of the
    walk, rewalking from wherever we left off when scheduled again. TDP
    MMU already does this, so it could be a wasted effort adding support
    for it to the ARM MMU if we are to switch over at some point.

WDYT?
