It doesn't look to me like FEAT_FGT offers any knobs to trap ERET from EL1.
Unless there's no other way, I would prefer not to have the emulation of one
feature depend on the presence of another feature,

See my reply [1] to a question someone asked in an earlier iteration of the
pKVM series. My conclusion is that it's impossible to stop the
invalidate_range_start() MMU notifiers from being invoked for pinned pages.
But I believe that can be circumvented passing the enum mmu_notifier_event
event field to the arm64 KVM code and use that to decide to do the
unmapping or not. I am still investigating that, but it looks promising.

I would say it's undesirable, not impractical. Like Marc said, vfio already
pins the entire guest memory with the VFIO_IOMMMU_MAP_DMA ioctl. The
difference there is that the SMMU tables are unmapped via the explicit
ioctl VFIO_IOMMU_UNMAP_DMA; the SMMU doesn't use the MMU notifiers to keep
in sync with host's stage 1 like KVM does.

I have a proposal to handle [2] that, if you want to have a look.
Basically, userspace tells KVM to never allow the guest to start profiling.
That means a possibly huge blackout window while the guest is being
migrated, but I don't see any better solutions.
