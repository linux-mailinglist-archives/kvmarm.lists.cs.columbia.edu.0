Correct.

See the vgic_get_phys_line_level() call. This is all about dealing
with an interrupt that was made pending in the LR, that the guest
didn't Ack, but instead decided to disable the timer.

In this case, we need to clear the pending bit and deactivate the
interrupt because nothing will perform the physical deactivation for
us.

What we add in the M1 case is that if the interrupt isn't pending
anymore at the virtual level, we also need to deactivate it at the
physical level, because there is no HW mechanism to enforce it.

The resample is at the HW level. We forcefully tell the interrupt
controller to deliver a pending interrupt (this is implemented as an
unmask under the hood).
