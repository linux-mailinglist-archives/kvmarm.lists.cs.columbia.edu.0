Sure, I'll return EBUSY if the VM has started regardless of the incoming value.

I agree that a write against another write should be fine without the
WRITE_ONCE. But my little concern was this write against a read
(unsure how userspace accesses these registers). I'm guessing it
shouldn't hurt to keep them in place, no? :)
