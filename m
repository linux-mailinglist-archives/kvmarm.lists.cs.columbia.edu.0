The event can be unregistered and reseted through hypercalls when it's
being handled. In this case, the unregistration for the event can't
be done immediately and has to be delayed until the handling is finished.
The unregistration pending state is used in this case. Yes, it's
correct we also can use (active & !registered) to represent the state.

Yep, we will simply rely on find_first_bit() for the priority. It means
the software signaled event, whose number is zero, will have the highest
priority.

Yes, one event is active at most on one particular vCPU. So tt don't
have to be a bitmap necessarily. The reason I proposed to use bitmap
for this state is to having all (event) states represented by bitmaps.
In this way, all states are managed in a unified fashion. The alternative
way is to have "unsigned long active_event", which traces the active
event number. It also consumes 8-bytes when live migration is concerned.
So I prefer a bitmap :)

Not really. We just need one single bit for vCPU's mask state. We need
multiple bits for event's active state, depending on how many events are
supported. We need to know which event is currently active at least.
For now, there are only two supported events (0/1), but one single bit
is still not enough because there are 3 states: (1) software signaled
event is active. (2) async pf event is active. (3) none of them is
active.

Lets use a bitmap for the event active state as I said above, if you
don't strongly object :)

I rethinking it a bit. Yes, you're correct. In this specific case, the
event handler is running for multiple events.

Yep, thanks again for your valuable comments :)

I prefer a separate series to support migration after this series gets
merged. There are couple of reasons to do so: (1) The migration depends
on Raghavendra's series to support for hypercall services selection.
The series is close to be merged, but not happen yet. The SDEI is one
of the hypercall services at least. SDEI's pseudo firmware registers
for migration will be managed by the infrastructure. (2) I would focus
on the core functinality for now. In this way, we give migration space.
For example, the data structures needs sorts of adjustments for migration,
just in case.

Yes, I meant to remove struct kvm_sdei_vcpu::lock by dropping the
locking mechanism :)
