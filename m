Hi Andrew,

Thanks for your comments and suggestions!

I like the idea of sharing info via a read of the CAP, and not having
to explicitly sanitize/clear the registers before the guest begins to
run.
However the handshake is done over an API doc, which is a little
concerning. The user-space must remember and explicitly clear any new
register that it doesn't want to expose to the guest, while the
current approach does this automatically.
Any bug in VMM's implementation could be risky and unintentionally
expose features to the guest. What do you think?

Good point. But IIUC, if the user-space is able to communicate the
info that it's expecting a certain get-reg-list, do you think it can
handle it at its end too, rather than relying on the kernel to send a
list back?

My assumption was that VMM would statically maintain a known set of
registers that it wants to work with and are to be modified by hand,
rather than relying on get-reg-list. This could be the least common
set of registers that are present in all the host kernels (higher or
lower versions) of the migration fleet. This config doesn't change
even with get-reg-list declaring a new register as the features
exposed by it could still be untested. Although, migrating to a host
with a missing register shouldn't be possible in this setting, but if
it encounters the scenario, it should be able to avoid migration to
the host (similar to QEMU).

Please correct me if you think it's a false assumption to proceed with.

Raghavendra
