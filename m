Urgh, that's weird. Am I getting thrown into spam or something? Also, do
you know if you've been receiving Drew's email since he switched to
@linux.dev?

Yeah, that would be good to follow up on what other OSes are doing.
You'll still have a nondestructive S2 fault handler for the SPE, right?
IOW, if PMBSR_EL1.DL=0 KVM will just unpin the old buffer and repin the
new one.
