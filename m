Yes, simply only enabling the cap seems to work fine in QEMU as well (as
in, 'mte selftests work fine'). Migration support is the
hard/interesting part.

Yes, that seems reasonable; not sure whether the documentation should
call that out explicitly.

For postcopy, we basically want to fault in any not-yet-migrated page
via uffd once the guest accesses it. We only get the page data that way,
though, not the tag. I'm wondering whether we'd need a 'page+metadata'
uffd mode; not sure if that makes sense. Otherwise, we'd need to stop
the guest while grabbing the tags for the page as well, and stopping is
the thing we want to avoid here.
