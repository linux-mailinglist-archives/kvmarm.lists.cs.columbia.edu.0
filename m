That's a completely different beast, really.

The clocksource pointer is handed in by the caller and the core code
validates if the clocksource is the same as the current system clocksource
and not the other way round.

So there is no need for getting that pointer from the core code because the
caller knows already which clocksource needs to be active to make.the whole
cross device timestamp correlation work. And in that case it's the callers
responsibility to ensure that the pointer is valid which is the case for
the current use cases.

From your other reply:

No, the clocksource pointer is not going to be exposed as there is no
guarantee that it will be still around after the call returns.

It's not even guaranteed to be correct when the store happens in Wu's patch
simply because the store is done outside of the seqcount protected region.

Vs. arch data: arch data is an opaque struct, so you'd need to store a
pointer which has the same issue as the clocksource pointer itself.

If we want to convey information then it has to be in the generic part
of struct clocksource.

In fact we could even simplify the existing get_device_system_crosststamp()
use case by using the ID field.

Thanks,
