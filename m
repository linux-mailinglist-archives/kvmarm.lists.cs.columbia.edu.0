Since you're moving the ESB from a HAS_RAS alternative location to a
normal location, it might be worth noting in the commit message that the
ESB is a NOP when RAS is not implemented, to clarify that we are not
uselessly adding a barrier (or potentially undefined instruction).

Having said the above, if the kernel is built without RAS support (you
have to disable some of options enabled by default to get to that) but
runs on a CPU that does have the RAS extention, should we execute a nop
instead of an esb (so have an alternative here)?

Also, when we have the smccc workaround installed we do two esb, is that
intentional/necessary?

Could we have only one esb at the start of hyp_ventry (and "only" 26
nops after it) for KVM_INDIRECT_VECTORS? Or does this not affect
performance that much to be of interest?
