Don't we have a usecase? Above you said that kvmtool should at least skip
the migration tests.

The current patch does both things; it says don't use --vmm and it says
the new --vmm is --target. I'm saying do one or the other. Either
completely rename vmm to target, which will then error out when vmm is
specified as an unknown option or allow the user to use either --vmm or
--target with no error and where both mean to do the same thing, which is
to set the TARGET variable.
