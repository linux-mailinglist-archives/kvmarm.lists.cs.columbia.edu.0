I don't like such negative flags and we should aim for minimal changes
to code that doesn't care about MTE. If there's a performance penalty
with zeroing the tags, we'll keep looking at the lazy tag
initialisation.

In the meantime, I'll think some more about the lazy stuff. We need at
least mte_sync_tags() fixed to set the PG_mte_tagged after the tags have
been updated (fixes the CoW + mprotect() race but probably breaks
concurrent MAP_SHARED mprotect()). We'd have to add some barriers (maybe
in a new function, set_page_tagged()). Some cases like restoring from
swap (both private and shared) have the page lock held. KVM doesn't seem
to take any page lock, so it can race with the VMM.

Anyway, I doubt we can get away with a single bit. We can't make use of
PG_locked either since set_pte_at() is called with the page either
locked or unlocked.
