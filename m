"highmem_ecam is keyed on highmem but not on the PA range". True but it
is properly taken into account in highest_gpa computation so eventually
we make sure it does not overflow the IPA limit. Same for the high mmio
region which is keyed on highmem.

couldn't you simply introduce highmem_redist which is truly missing. You
could set it in virt_set_memmap() in case you skip extended_map overlay
and use it in virt_gicv3_redist_region_count() as you did?
In addition to the device memory top address check against the 4GB limit
if !highmem, we should be fine then?
