I'm planning to propose exactly this in the next series; any GIC
interrupt will wake the guest. I'd argue that if someone wants to do
anything else, their window of opportunity is the exit to userspace.

Agreed. I was mulling on exactly how to clue in the VMM about the
suspend state. What if we just encode it in KVM_{GET,SET}_MP_STATE? We'd
avoid the need for new UAPI that way. We could introduce a new state,
KVM_MP_STATE_SUSPENDED, which would clue KVM to do the suspend as we've
discussed. We would exit to userspace with KVM_MP_STATE_RUNNABLE,
meaning the VMM would need to set the MP state explicitly for the
in-kernel suspend to work.

That'd be very helpful!
