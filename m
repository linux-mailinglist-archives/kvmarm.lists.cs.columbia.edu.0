We may have to to that anyway at some point. If the "KVM compartment"
thing becomes real, we may have to end-up compiling both separately
(and jettison the one we don't need at runtime).

I need to educate myself about objtool. Seems to be the miracle cure
for a lot of ailments! ;-)

Anyway, I've now queued the series for 5.6.
