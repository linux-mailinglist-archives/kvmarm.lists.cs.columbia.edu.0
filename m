I don't think it's the asm because in that case the counter value should
be the same every time (even if wrong).

Actually, the "bare metal" tests I performed were on a prototype
passthrough implementation:
https://github.com/ricarkol/linux/commit/c2b009e813e18e89d6945915bd3ae5787b=
be3164
Let me know how it goes.
