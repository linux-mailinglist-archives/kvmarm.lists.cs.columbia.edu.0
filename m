I didn't make it clear. With this patchset we still support !VHE systems 
by choose CONFIG_KVM_ARM_HOST as y and by default CONFIG_KVM_ARM_HOST is 
y. And during module init, I add a check to avoid wrong usage for kvm 
module.

if (IS_MODULE(CONFIG_KVM_ARM_HOST) && !is_kernel_in_hyp_mode()) {
         kvm_err("kvm arm kernel module only supports for VHE system\n");
         return -ENODEV;
}

Actually we can limit this feature only working for VHE systems and 
don't influence !VHE systems.

Thanks,
