Thank you for providing an important data point to this question.

Can you provide some more information about how you use KVM on 32-bit
machines, to make it possible to better estimate how many others might
do the same, and how long you will need to upgrade to newer kernels for?

In particular:

- What is the smallest amount of physical RAM that you have to found to
   make a usable ARM/KVM host? Note that the 4GB configuration of the
   Tegra K1 (an rk3288) Chromebooks seems to be extremely rare in other
   devices, while most new 32-bit SBCs come with 1GB or less these days.

- How often do you update the host kernels on those 32-bit machines that
  you still use to newer releases? What is the oldest/newest you run at the
  moment?

- Are you able to move the host installation to a distribution with a long-term
  stable release cycle such as Debian, Ubuntu that gives you a ~five year
  support after a kernel release?

         Arnd
