I'm not sure I understand exactly what would be improved by making this
either more architecture speific or more architecture generic.  The
EA bit will always be set, that's why the field is called
'ext_dabt_pending'.

I thought as per the previous discussion, that we were specifically
trying to avoid userspace emulating the exception in detail, so I
designed this to provide the minimal effort API for userspace.

Since we already have an architecture specific ioctl, kvm_vcpu_events, I
don't think we're painting ourselves into a corner by using that.  Is a
natural consequence of what you're saying not that we should try to make
that whole call architecture generic?

Unless we already have specific examples of how other architectures
would want to use something like this, and given the impact of this
patch, I'm not sure it's worth trying to speculate about that.

If we took one of the supported exits from a VM with nested virt
support, it means that you either had a fault from the guest hypervisor,
or a fault from a nested guest where the guest hypervisor has set up a
virtual stage 2 mapping to a hole in the VM's IPA space.  In the former
case, the exception would be delivered back to guest hypervisor, and in
the latter case the target depends on the guest hypervisor's
configuration of the virtual HCR_EL2(.TEA), which the kernel should
respect when handling the KVM_SET_VCPU_EVENTS ioctl.
