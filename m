There are couple of reasons, not to share tools/testing/selftests/rseq/librseq.so
or add tools/lib/librseq.so. Please let me know if the arguments making sense
to you?

- By design, selftests/rseq and selftests/kvm are parallel. It's going to introduce
   unnecessary dependency for selftests/kvm to use selftests/rseq/librseq.so. To me,
   it makes the maintainability even harder.

- What selftests/kvm needs is rseq-thread-pointer.h, which accounts for ~5% of
   functionalities, provided by selftests/rseq/librseq.so.

- I'm not too much familiar with selftests/rseq, but it seems it need heavy
   rework before it can become tools/lib/librseq.so. However, I'm not sure if
   the effort is worthwhile. The newly added library is fully used by
   testtests/rseq. ~5% of that is going to be used by selftests/kvm.
   In this case, we still have cross-dependency issue.

I personally prefer not to use selftests/rseq/librseq.so or add tools/lib/librseq.so,
but I need your feedback. Please share your thoughts.
Thanks,
Gavin
