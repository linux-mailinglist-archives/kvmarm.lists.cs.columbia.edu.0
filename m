But what about the memory map that are freed during boot (mentioned above).
Would not they still cause CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE to be applicable and hence
pfn_valid_within() ?

Just to understand this better, pfn_valid() will now return true for all
MEMBLOCK_NOMAP based memory but that is okay as core MM would still ignore
them as unusable memory for being PageReserved().
