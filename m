I agree this needs some investigation - I'm hoping Haibo will be able to 
provide some feedback here as he has been looking at the QEMU support. 
However the VMM is likely going to require some significant changes to 
ensure that migration doesn't break, so either way there's work to be done.

Fundamentally most memory will need a mapping with PROT_MTE just so the 
VMM can get at the tags for migration purposes, so QEMU is going to have 
to learn how to treat guest memory specially if it wants to be able to 
enable MTE for both itself and the guest.

I'll also hunt down what's happening with my attempts to fix the 
set_pte_at() handling for swap and I'll post that as an alternative if 
it turns out to be a reasonable approach. But I don't think that solve 
the QEMU issue above.

The other alternative would be to implement a new kernel interface to 
fetch tags from the guest and not require the VMM to maintain a PROT_MTE 
mapping. But we need some real feedback from someone familiar with QEMU 
to know what that interface should look like. So I'm holding off on that 
until there's a 'real' PoC implementation.

Thanks,

Steve
