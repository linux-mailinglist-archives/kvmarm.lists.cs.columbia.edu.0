So I actually wanted to bring up the issue of user visibility, glad your
test picked up something.

This has two implications, which are rather odd.

 - When UFFD is in use, translation faults are reported to userspace as
   writes when from a RW memslot and reads when from an RO memslot.

 - S1 page table memory is spuriously marked as dirty, as we presume a
   write immediately follows the translation fault. That isn't entirely
   senseless, as it would mean both the target page and the S1 PT that
   maps it are both old. This is nothing new I suppose, just weird.

Marc, do you have any concerns about leaving this as-is for the time
being? At least before we were doing the same thing (write fault) every
time.
