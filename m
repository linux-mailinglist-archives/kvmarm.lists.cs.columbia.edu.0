So I gave that a shot with some benchmarks. As expected, it is quite hard
to show an improvement with just one guest running, although we could show
a 103%(!) improvement of the memcached QPS score in one experiment when
running it in a guest with an external load generator.
Throwing more users into the game showed a significant improvement:

Benchmark 1: kernel compile/FIO: Compiling a kernel on the host, while
letting a guest run FIO with 4K randreads from a passed-through NVMe SSD:
The IOPS with this series improved by 27% compared to pure mainline,
reaching 80% of the host value. Kernel compilation time improved by 8.5%
compared to mainline.

Benchmark 2: FIO/FIO: Running FIO on a passed through SATA SSD in one
guest, and FIO on a passed through NVMe SSD in another guest, at the same
time:
The IOPS with this series improved by 23% for the NVMe and 34% for the
SATA disk, compared to pure mainline.

So judging from these results, I think this series is a significant
improvement, which justifies it to be merged, to receive wider testing.

It would be good if others could also do performance experiments and post
their results.

Cheers,
Andre.
