Yes, these problems looks knotty. But I think x86 PML support will face these
problems too. I believe there must be some methods to solve them.

Sure, PML is a better solution on hardware management of dirty state.
However, compared to optimizing hardware, optimizing software is with
shorter cycle time.

Here I have an optimization in mind to solve it. Scanning page tables
can be done parallel, which can greatly reduce time consumption. For there
is no communication between parallel CPUs, we can achieve high speedup
ratio.
