I think then you would end up with the possible mismatch between
kvm->arch.pmuver and the version of the PMU that is used for creating the
events.

Also, as VCPUs get migrated from one physical CPU to the other, the
semantics of the microarchitectural events change, even if the event ID is
the same.
