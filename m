It's my hope that this test, especially now after its refactoring, will
allow us to test all configurations easily and therefore frequently.

I'm not sure I understand how we should change the development and
review processes. As for testing, with simple tests like this one,
we can actually achieve exhaustive configuration testing fast, at
least with respect to checking for expected registers and checking
that we can get/set_one_reg on them. If we were to try and setup
QEMU migration tests for all the possible configurations, then it
would take way too long.
