If you mean this bit:

On arm64, the physical address size for a VM (IPA Size limit) is limited
to 40bits by default. The limit can be configured if the host supports the
extension KVM_CAP_ARM_VM_IPA_SIZE. When supported, use
KVM_VM_TYPE_ARM_IPA_SIZE(IPA_Bits) to set the size in the machine type
identifier, where IPA_Bits is the maximum width of any physical
address used by the VM.

And then below there is this paragraph:

Please note that configuring the IPA size does not affect the capability
exposed by the guest CPUs in ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1[PARange]. It only affects
**size of the address translated by the stage2 level (guest physical to
host physical address translations)**.

Emphasis added by me.

It looks to me like the two paragraph state different things, first says
the IPA size caps "the physical address size for a VM", the second that it
caps the RAM size - "size of the address translated by the stage 2 level.

I have no problem with either, but it looks confusing.

So if a VMM that wants to put devices above RAM it must make sure that the
IPA size is extended to match, did I get that right?

I'm also a bit confused about the rationale. Why is the PARange exposed to
the guest in effect the wrong value, because the true PARange is defined by
IPA size?

Thanks,
Alex
