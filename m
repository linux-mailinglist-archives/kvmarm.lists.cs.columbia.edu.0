In all honesty, I think the amount of work that is getting added to
support this "migration cancelled mid-way" use case is getting out
of control.

This is adding a complexity and corner cases for a use case that
really shouldn't happen that often. And it is adding it at the worse
possible place, where we really should keep things as straightforward
as possible.

I would expect userspace to have a good enough knowledge of whether
the migration is likely to succeed, and not to attempt it if it is
likely to fail. And yes, it will fail sometimes. But it should be
so rare that adding this various stages of BBM support shouldn't be
that useful.

Or is there something else that I am missing?

Thanks,

         M.
