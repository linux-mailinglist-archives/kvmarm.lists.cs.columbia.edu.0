Hi all,

Please refresh my memory. Does this series work on current platforms? Or
was it introducing new test failures which may be in the test, as opposed
to KVM? If they work on most platforms, but not on every platform, then
have we identified what triggers them to fail and whether that should be
fixed or just worked-around? I'm sorry I still can't help out with the
testing as I haven't yet had time to setup the Rpi that Mark Rutland gave
me in Dublin.

I know this series has been rotting on arm/queue for months, so I'll be
happy to merge it if the consensus is to do so. I can also drop it, or
some of the patches, if that's the consensus.

Thanks,
drew
