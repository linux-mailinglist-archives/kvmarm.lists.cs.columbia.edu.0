KVM/arm was merged just over 7 years ago, and has lived a very quiet
life so far. It mostly works if you're prepared to deal with its
limitations, it has been a good prototype for the arm64 version,
but it suffers a few problems:

- It is incomplete (no debug support, no PMU)
- It hasn't followed any of the architectural evolutions
- It has zero users (I don't count myself here)
- It is more and more getting in the way of new arm64 developments

So here it is: unless someone screams and shows that they rely on
KVM/arm to be maintained upsteam, I'll remove 32bit host support
form the tree. One of the reasons that makes me confident nobody is
using it is that I never receive *any* bug report. Yes, it is perfect.
But if you depend on KVM/arm being available in mainline, please shout.

To reiterate: 32bit guest support for arm64 stays, of course. Only
32bit host goes. Once this is merged, I plan to move virt/kvm/arm to
arm64, and cleanup all the now unnecessary abstractions.

The patches have been generated with the -D option to avoid spamming
everyone with huge diffs, and there is a kvm-arm/goodbye branch in
my kernel.org repository.

Marc Zyngier (5):
  arm: Unplug KVM from the build system
  arm: Remove KVM from config files
  arm: Remove 32bit KVM host support
  arm: Remove HYP/Stage-2 page-table support
  arm: Remove GICv3 vgic compatibility macros
