We could use kvm_vcpu_yield_to to yield to a specific vcpu, but how 
would we determine which vcpu to yield to?

IMO vcpu_is_preempted is very well integrated in a lot of core kernel 
code, i.e. mutex, rtmutex, rwsem and osq_lock. It is also used in 
scheduler to determine better which vCPU we can run on soonest, select 
idle core, etc. I am not sure if all of these cases will be optimized by 
pvcy? Also, with vcpu_is_preempted, some of the lock heavy benchmarks 
come down from spending around 50% of the time in lock to less than 1% 
(so not sure how much more room is there for improvement).

We could also use vcpu_is_preempted to optimize IPI performance (along 
with directed yield to target IPI vCPU) similar to how its done in x86 
(https://lore.kernel.org/all/1560255830-8656-2-git-send-email-wanpengli@tencent.com/). 
This case definitely wont be covered by pvcy.

Considering all the above, i.e. the core kernel integration already 
present and possible future usecases of vcpu_is_preempted, maybe its 
worth making vcpu_is_preempted work on arm independently of pvcy?

Usama
