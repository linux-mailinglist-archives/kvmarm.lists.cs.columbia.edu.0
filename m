"lazy" in that requiring a non-zero value would mean adding another #define,
otherwise the extensibility is limited to two values.  Again, unlikely to matter,
but it wouldn't make sense to go through the effort to provide some extensibility
and then only allow for one possible extension.  If KVM is "lazy" and just requires
flags to be '0', then there's no need for more #defines, and userspace doesn't
have to pass more values in its enabling.

Yes, or more likely, tweaking the behavior of ring+bitmap.  As is, the behavior
is purely a fallback for a single case where KVM can't push to the dirty ring due
to not having a running vCPU.  It's possible someone might come up with a use case
where they want KVM to do something different, e.g. fallback to the bitmap if the
ring is full.

In other words, it's mostly to hedge against futures we haven't thought of.  Reserving
cap->flags is cheap and easy for both KVM and userspace, so there's no real reason
not to do so.

I'll look at v10, I don't like providing reviews that are conditional on changes
that are more than nits.

That said, there're no remaining issues that can't be sorted out on top, so don't
hold up v10 if I don't look at it in a timely manner for whatever reason.  I agree
with Marc that it'd be good to get this in -next sooner than later.
