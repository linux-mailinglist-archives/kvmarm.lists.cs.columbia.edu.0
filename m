I'm pretty sure we need some form of barrier in here to ensure the tag
clearing is visible to the other CPU. Otherwise I can't immediately see
any problems with the approach of a second flag (it was something I had
considered). But I do also think we should seriously consider Catalin's
approach of simply zeroing tags unconditionally - it would certainly
simplify the code.

The main issue with unconditionally zeroing is if you then want to
(ab)use the tag memory carveout as extra memory for regions that are not
being used for tags. Personally it seems pretty crazy (a whole lot of
extra complexity for a small gain in ram), and I'm not convinced that
memory is sufficiently moveable for it to reliably work.

I agree - when I considered this before it was using the second flag as
a lock.
