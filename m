Apologies for the delay on this one, I was away for a while.

Yup, that all makes sense. FWIW the pKVM use-case I have in mind is
slightly different. Specifically, in the pKVM world the hypervisor
maintains a stage-2 for the host, that is all identity mapped. So we use
nice big block mappings as much as we can. But when a protected guest
starts, the hypervisor needs to break down the host stage-2 blocks to
unmap the 4K guest pages from the host (which is where the protection
comes from in pKVM). And when the guest is torn down, the host can
reclaim its pages, hence putting us in a position to coallesce its
stage-2 into nice big blocks again. Note that none of this coallescing
is currently implemented even in our pKVM prototype, so it's a bit
unfair to ask you to deal with this stuff now, but clearly it'd be cool
if there was a way we could make these things coexist and even ideally
share some code...
