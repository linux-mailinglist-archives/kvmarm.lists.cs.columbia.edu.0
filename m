Nothing. It is just a slight nitnoid thing for me where
KVM_EXIT_SYSTEM_SUSPEND behaves a bit differently than the others. If
a VMM wants to reject the call, it needs to manually set up the SMCCC
return value, whereas on the others a naive call to KVM_RUN will do
the job since KVM already sets up the failure value.

Unsure if this warrants a kvm_run change, leaning towards no if it is
well documented.

Sure thing. I'll keep it to kvmtool, since that's the most familiar to
me. Also, I think I had an RFC for kvmtool many moons ago...
