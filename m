Not always, at least as how it's called from hva_to_pfn(). My reading of
the get_user_page_fast_only() is that it doesn't touch the pte, just
walks the page tables and pins the page. Of course, it expects a valid
pte to have been set in the VMM already, otherwise it doesn't pin any
page and the caller falls back to the slow path.

The slow path, get_user_pages_unlocked(), passes FOLL_TOUCH and
set_pte_at() will be called either in follow_pfn_pte() if it was valid
or via faultin_page() -> handle_mm_fault().

I don't think it helps if we checked such vma flag in user_mem_abort(),
we'd still have the race with set_pte_at() on the page flags. What I was
trying to avoid is touching the page flags in too many places, so
deferring this always to set_pte_at() in the VMM.

If we kept this check to the VMM set_pte_at(), I think we can ignore the
notifiers.

I agree, tying it to the process looks wrong, only that it's less
intrusive. I don't think it would break anything, only potential
performance regression. A process would still need to pass PROT_MTE to
be able to get tag checking. That's basically what I had in an early MTE
implementation with clear_user_page() always zeroing the tags.

I agree with you that a vma flag would be better but it's more
complicated without an additional pte bit. We could also miss some
updates as mprotect() for example checks for pte_same() before calling
set_pte_at() (it would need to check the updated vma flags).

I'll review the latest series but I'm tempted to move the logic in
santise_mte_tags() to mte.c and take the big lock in there if
PG_mte_tagged is not already set. If we hit performance issues, we can
optimise this later to have the page flag set already on creation (new
PROT flag, prctl etc.).
