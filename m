More than that, it allows userspace to select which PMU will be used
for their guest. The affinity setting is a byproduct of the PMU's own
affinity.

Of course we do. This is a behaviour that has been exposed to userspace
for years, and *we don't break userspace*.

People running KVM on asymmetric systems *strongly* disagree with you.
