There are two stages of page fault. The guest kernel is responsible
for handling stage one page fault, while the host kernel is to take
care of the stage two page fault. When page fault is triggered because
of stage two page fault, the guest is suspended until the requested
memory (page) is populated. Sometimes, the cost to populate the requested
page isn't cheap and can take hundreds of milliseconds in extreme
cases. This impacts the overall guest's performance.

This series introduces the feature (asynchronous page fault) to resolve
the issue and improve the guest's performance. It depends on the series
to support SDEI virtualization and refactoring SDEI client driver. This
also depends on QEMU changes to export SDEI/APFT tables. All the code
including this series can be found from github:

   https://github.com/gwshan/linux ("sdei_client")
   https://github.com/gwshan/linux ("sdei")
   https://github.com/gwshan/linux ("apf")
   https://github.com/gwshan/qemu  ("apf")

The functionality is driven by two notifications: page-not-present and
page-ready. They're delivered from the host to guest via SDEI event and
PPI separately. In the mean while, each notification is always associated
with a token, used to identify the notification. The token is passed by
the shared memory between host/guest. Besides, the SMCCC interface is
mitigated by the guest to configure, enable or disable the functionality.
It's traditional control path.

When the guest is trapped to host because of stage two page fault, a
page-not-present notification is raised by the host, and sent to the guest
through (KVM private) SDEI event (0x40200001) if the requested page can't
be populated immediately. In the mean while, a (background) worker is also
started to populate the requested page. On receiving the SDEI event, the
guest marks the current running process with special flag (TIF_ASYNC_PF)
and associates the process with a pre-defined waitqueue. At same time,
a (reschedule) IPI is sent to the CPU where the process was running.
After the SDEI event is acknoledged by the guest, the (reschedule) IPI
is delivered and it causes context switch from kernel to user space.
During the context switch, the process with TIF_ASYNC_PF flag is
suspended on the associated waitqueue.

Later on, a page-ready notification is sent to guest after the requested
page is populated by the (background) worker. On receiving the interrupt,
the guest uses the associated token to locate the process, which was
previously suspended because of page-not-present, and wakes it up.

The series is organized as below:

PATCH[1-2]: support KVM hypervisor SMCCC services, which are developed by
            Will Deacon.
PATCH[3]:   export kvm_handle_user_mem_abort() with @prefault parameter
            supported, which is prepatory work to support the feature.
PATCH[4]:   support asynchronous page fault in host side.
PATCH[5]:   exposes APFT (Asynchronous Page Fault Table) ACPI table, which
            will be used by guest kernel to support the feature
PATCH[6]:   support asynchronous page fault in guest side.

=======
Testing
=======

In the test case [1] and [2], "testsuite mem" is executed to allocate
the specified percentage of free memory (90%) and then release them.
In the mean while, the calculation thread is started or not. When
the calculation thread isn't started, there isn't obvious performance
degradtion. When the calculation thread is started, the performance
is improved by 27.7% and 28.6% separately, depending on THP enablement
sttus on the host side.

In test case [3] and [4], the kernel image is built and check the
used time. The performance is improved by 9.7% and 9.9% separately,
depending on THP enablement status on the host side.
