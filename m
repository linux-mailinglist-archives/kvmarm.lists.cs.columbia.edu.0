Ok.

The GIC state would be just one case where no vcpu can be used to push
dirty page information. As you mentioned, SMMMU HTTU feature could possibly
be another case to ARM64. It's uncertain about other architectures where
dirty-ring will be supported. In QEMU, the dirty (bitmap) logging is enabled
at the beginning of migration and the bitmap is synchronized to global
dirty bitmap and RAMBlock's dirty bitmap gradually, as the following
backtrace shows. What we need to do for QEMU is probably retrieve the
bitmap at point (A).

Without the new capability, we will have to rely on the return value
from ioctls KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG and KVM_CLEAR_DIRTY_LOG to detect the
capability. For example, -ENXIO is returned on old kernels.

Note: for post-copy and snapshot, I assume we need to save the dirty bitmap
       in the last synchronization, right after the VM is stopped.

Ok. I don't know the details. Marc, the dirty bitmap is helpful in this case?
