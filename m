I see.

My main issue here was just that it's really difficult to see how the
entry/exit logic is balanced, and I reckon we can solve that by splitting
guest_{enter,exit}_irqoff() into helper functions to handle the vtime
accounting separately from the context tracking, so that arch code can do
something like:

  guest_timing_enter_irqoff();
  
  guest_eqs_enter_irqoff();
  < actually run vCPU here >
  guest_eqs_exit_irqoff();
  
  < handle pending IRQs here >
  
  guest_timing_exit_irqoff();

... which I hope should work for RISC-V too.

I've had a go, and I've pushed out a WIP to:

  https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mark/linux.git/log/?h=arm64/kvm/rcu

I also see we'll need to add some lockdep/irq-tracing management to arm64, and
it probably makes sense to fold that into common helpers, so I'll have a play
with that tomorrow.

Thanks,
Mark.
