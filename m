IIRC we won't have a a guaranteed schedular tick for NO_HZ_FULL, so in
that case we'll either need to set a period software maintenance
interrupt, or reject this combination at runtime (either when trying to
isolate the dynticks CPUs, or when trying to create a VM).

Otherwise, it's very likely that something will take us out of the guest
from time to time, but we won't have a strict guarantee (e.g. if all
guest memory is pinned).

Thanks,
Mark.
