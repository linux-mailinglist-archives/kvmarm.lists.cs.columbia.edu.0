From an architectural point of view, the PE can speculate instruction
fetches and data reads at any time when the MMU is enabled using the
translation tables from TTBR0_EL1 and TTBR1_EL1. kvm-unit-tests uses an
identity map, and as such it only programs TTBR0_EL1 with a valid table and
leaves TTBR1_EL1 unchanged. The reset value for TTBR1_EL1 is UNKNOWN, which
means it is possible for the PE to perform reads from memory locations
where accesses can cause side effects (like memory-mapped devices) as part
of the speculated translation table walk.

So far, this hasn't been a problem, because KVM resets TTBR{0,1}_EL1 to
zero, and that address is used for emulation for both qemu and kvmtool and
it doesn't point to a real device. However, kvm-unit-tests shouldn't rely
on a particular combination of hypervisor and userspace for correctness.
Another situation where we can't rely on these assumptions being true is
when kvm-unit-tests is run as an EFI app.

To prevent reads from arbitrary addresses, set the TCR_EL1.EPD1 bit to
disable speculative translation table walks using TTBR1_EL1.

This is similar to EDK2 commit fafb7e9c110e ("ArmPkg: correct TTBR1_EL1
settings in TCR_EL1"). Also mentioned in that commit is the Cortex-A57
erratum 822227 which impacts the hypervisor, but kvm-unit-tests is
protected against it because asm_mmu_enable sets both the TCR_EL1.TG0 and
TCR_EL1.TG1 bits when programming the register.
