At the time this was designed, I was working on VFIO platform IRQ
forwarding using direct EOI and they were used (and useful)

+	irq->producer.stop = vfio_platform_irq_bypass_stop;
+	irq->producer.start = vfio_platform_irq_bypass_start;

[PATCH v4 02/13] VFIO: platform: registration of a dummy IRQ bypass producer
[PATCH v4 07/13] VFIO: platform: add irq bypass producer management
https://lists.cs.columbia.edu/pipermail/kvmarm/2015-November/017323.html

basically the IRQ was disabled and re-enabled. This series has never
been upstreamed but that's where it originates from.

right, sorry I had in mind the set_forwarding was partially successful
for 3 of 4 LPIs but it is a unitary operation.

OK. So with the revert, the use case resume working, right?
