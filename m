In KVM/arm64, values of ID registers for a guest are mostly same as
its host's values except for bits for feature that KVM doesn't support
and for opt-in features that userspace didn't configure.  Userspace
can use KVM_SET_ONE_REG to a set ID register value, but it fails
if userspace attempts to modify the register value.

This patch series adds support to allow userspace to modify a value of
ID registers (as long as KVM can support features that are indicated
in the registers) so userspace can have more control of configuring
and unconfiguring features for guests.  We need this because we would
like to expose a uniform set/level of features for a group of guests on
systems with different ARM CPUs.  Since some features are not binary
in nature (e.g. AA64DFR0_EL1.BRPs fields indicate number of
breakpoints minus 1), using KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT to control such features
is inconvenient.  This will be supported only for AArch64 EL1 guests at
least for now.

The patch series is for both VHE and non-VHE, except for protected VMs,
which have a different way of configuring ID registers based on its
different requirements [1].
There was a patch series that tried to achieve the same thing [2].
A few snippets of codes in this series were inspired by or came from [2].

The initial value of ID registers for a vCPU will be the host's value
with bits cleared for unsupported features and for opt-in features that
were not configured. So, the initial value userspace can see (via
KVM_GET_ONE_REG) is the upper limit that can be set for the register.
Any requests to change the value that conflicts with opt-in features'
configuration will fail (e.g. if KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3 is configured by
KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT, ID_AA64DFR0_EL1.PMUVER cannot be set to zero.
Otherwise, the initial value of ID_AA64DFR0_EL1.PMUVER will be zero,
and cannot be changed from zero).

When a guest tries to use a CPU feature that is not exposed to the guest,
trapping it (to emulate a real CPU's behavior) would generally be a
desirable behavior (when it is possible with no or little side effects).
The later patches in the series add codes for this.  Only features that
can be trapped independently will be trapped by this series though.

Highest numbered breakpoints must be context aware breakpoints
(as specified by Arm ARM).  If the number of non-context aware
breakpoints for the guest is decreased by userspace (e.g. Lower
ID_AA64DFR0.BRPs keeping ID_AA64DFR0.CTX_CMPs the same), simply
narrowing the breakpoints will be problematic because it will
lead to narrowing context aware breakpoints for the guest. In this
case, KVM will always trap and emulate breakpoints/watchpoints
accesses in that case.

This series adds kunit tests for new functions in sys_regs.c (except for
trivial ones), and these tests are enabled with a new configuration
option 'CONFIG_KVM_KUNIT_TEST'.

The series is based on 5.18-rc3.

Patch 01 introduces arm64_check_features(), which will validate
ID registers based on given arm64_ftr_bits[].

Patch 02 introduces id_regs[] to kvm_arch to save values of ID
registers.

Patches 03-04 introduces structure id_reg_desc to manage the ID register
specific control for the guest.

Patch 05 prohibits modifying values of ID regs for 32bit EL1 guests.

Patches 06-11 introduces id_reg_desc for ID_AA64PFR0_EL1, ID_AA64PFR1_EL1,
ID_AA64ISAR0_EL1, ID_AA64ISAR1_EL1, ID_AA64ISAR2_EL1 and ID_AA64MMFR0_EL1
to make them configurable.

Patches 12-14 take cares emulation of dbgbcr/dbgbvr/dbgwcr when the number
of non-context aware breakpoints are reduced for the guest.

Patches 15-19 introduces id_reg_desc for remaining ID registers to
make them configurable.

Patch 20 switches to use id_reg_desc_table[] for ID registers instead
of sys_reg_descs[].

Patch 21 introduces consistency checking of feature fractional
fields of ID registers at the first KVM_RUN.

Patch 22 introduces a new capability KVM_CAP_ARM_ID_REG_WRITABLE
to identify that ID registers are configurable by userspace.

Patch 23 introduces kunit test cases for sys_reg.c changes.

Patches 24-25 change the way of using vcpu->arch.cptr_el2/mdcr_el2 to
track certain bits of cptr_el2/mdcr_el2 in the vcpu->arch fields and use
them when setting them for the guest.  The following patches will update
the vcpu->arch fields based on available features for the guest.

Patch 26 introduces struct feature_config_ctrl and some helper
functions to enable trapping of features that are disabled for a guest.

Patches 27-31 add feature_config_ctrl for CPU features, which are
used to program configuration registers to trap each of the features.

Patch 32 adds kunit test cases for changes in patches 26-31.

Patch 33 adds a couple of helpers for selftests to extract a field of
ID registers.

Patch 34 adds a selftest to validate reading/writing ID registers.

Patches 35-38 add test cases for dbgbcr/dbgbvr/dbgwcr emulation
to the debug-exceptions test.

v7:
  - Add emulation of dbgbcr/dbgbvr/dbgwcr when the number of non-context
    aware breakpoints are reduced for the guest.

    accept arm64_ftr_bits as an argument.
