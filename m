Fair enough. I was worried of the behaviour difference between HW 
without
PtrAuth and a guest with HW not advertised. Ideally, they should have
the same behaviour, but the architecture feels a bit brittle here.

Anyway, I'll drop this patch, and hopefully no guest will play this
game (they'll know pretty quickly about the issue anyway).

Thanks,

         M.
