No worries, we are not that far ahead either ;).

Steven to confirm but I think he only played with kvmtool. Adding
Jean-Philippe who also had Qemu on his plans at some point.

Yes. For migration, the VMM could ignore sending over tags that are all
zeros or maybe use some simple compression. We don't have a way to
disable MTE for guests, so all pages mapped into the guest address space
end up with PG_mte_tagged.

Wouldn't this be the same as migrating data? The VMM would only copy it
after it was marked read-only. BTW, I think sanitise_mte_tags() needs a
barrier before setting the PG_mte_tagged() flag (unless we end up with
some lock for reading the tags).

I don't follow the qemu list, so I wasn't even aware of that thread. But
postcopy, the VMM needs to ensure that both the data and tags are up to
date before mapping such page into the guest address space.
