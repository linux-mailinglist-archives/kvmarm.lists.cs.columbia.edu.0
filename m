+Asynchronous Page Fault Support for arm64
+=========================================
+
+There are two stages of page faults when KVM module is enabled as accelerator
+to the guest. The guest is responsible for handling the stage-1 page faults,
+while the host handles the stage-2 page faults. During the period of handling
+the stage-2 page faults, the guest is suspended until the requested page is
+ready. It could take several milliseconds, even hundreds of milliseconds in
+extreme situations because I/O might be required to move the requested page
+from disk to DRAM. The guest does not do any work when it is suspended. The
+feature (Asynchronous Page Fault) is introduced to take advantage of the
+suspending period and to improve the overall performance.
+
+There are two paths in order to fulfil the asynchronous page fault, called
+as control path and data path. The control path allows the VMM or guest to
+configure the functionality, while the notifications are delivered in data
+path. The notifications are classified into page-not-present and page-ready
+notifications.
+
+Data Path
+---------
+
+There are two types of notifications delivered from host to guest in the
+data path: page-not-present and page-ready notification. They are delivered
+through SDEI event and (PPI) interrupt separately. Besides, there is a shared
+buffer between host and guest to indicate the reason and sequential token,
+which is used to identify the asynchronous page fault. The reason and token
+resident in the shared buffer is written by host, read and cleared by guest.
+An asynchronous page fault is delivered and completed as below.
+
+(1) When an asynchronous page fault starts, a (workqueue) worker is created
+    and queued to the vCPU's pending queue. The worker makes the requested
+    page ready and resident to DRAM in the background. The shared buffer is
+    updated with reason and sequential token. After that, SDEI event is sent
+    to guest as page-not-present notification.
+
+(2) When the SDEI event is received on guest, the current process is tagged
+    with TIF_ASYNC_PF and associated with a wait queue. The process is ready
+    to keep rescheduling itself on switching from kernel to user mode. After
+    that, a reschedule IPI is sent to current CPU and the received SDEI event
+    is acknowledged. Note that the IPI is delivered when the acknowledgment
+    on the SDEI event is received on host.
+
+(3) On the host, the worker is dequeued from the vCPU's pending queue and
+    enqueued to its completion queue when the requested page becomes ready.
+    In the mean while, KVM_REQ_ASYNC_PF request is sent the vCPU if the
+    worker is the first element enqueued to the completion queue.
+
+(4) With pending KVM_REQ_ASYNC_PF request, the first worker in the completion
+    queue is dequeued and destroyed. In the mean while, a (PPI) interrupt is
+    sent to guest with updated reason and token in the shared buffer.
+
+(5) When the (PPI) interrupt is received on guest, the affected process is
+    located using the token and waken up after its TIF_ASYNC_PF tag is cleared.
+    After that, the interrupt is acknowledged through SMCCC interface. The
+    workers in the completion queue is dequeued and destroyed if any workers
+    exist, and another (PPI) interrupt is sent to the guest.
+
+Control Path
+------------
+
+The configurations are passed through SMCCC or ioctl interface. The SDEI
+event and (PPI) interrupt are owned by VMM, so the SDEI event and interrupt
+numbers are configured through ioctl command on per-vCPU basis. Besides,
+the functionality might be enabled and configured through ioctl interface
+by VMM during migration:
+
+   * KVM_ARM_ASYNC_PF_CMD_GET_VERSION
+
+     Returns the current version of the feature, supported by the host. It is
+     made up of major, minor and revision fields. Each field is one byte in
+     length.
+
+   * KVM_ARM_ASYNC_PF_CMD_GET_SDEI:
+
+     Retrieve the SDEI event number, used for page-not-present notification,
+     so that it can be configured on destination VM in the scenario of
+     migration.
+
+   * KVM_ARM_ASYNC_PF_GET_IRQ:
+
+     Retrieve the IRQ (PPI) number, used for page-ready notification, so that
+     it can be configured on destination VM in the scenario of migration.
+
+   * KVM_ARM_ASYNC_PF_CMD_GET_CONTROL
+
+     Retrieve the address of control block, so that it can be configured on
+     destination VM in the scenario of migration.
+
+   * KVM_ARM_ASYNC_PF_CMD_SET_SDEI:
+
+     Used by VMM to configure number of SDEI event, which is used to deliver
+     page-not-present notification by host. This is used when VM is started
+     or migrated.
+
+   * KVM_ARM_ASYNC_PF_CMD_SET_IRQ
+
+     Used by VMM to configure number of (PPI) interrupt, which is used to
+     deliver page-ready notification by host. This is used when VM is started
+     or migrated.
+
+   * KVM_ARM_ASYNC_PF_CMD_SET_CONTROL
+
+     Set the control block on the destination VM in the scenario of migration.
+
+The other configurations are passed through SMCCC interface. The host exports
+the capability through KVM vendor specific service, which is identified by
+ARM_SMCCC_KVM_FUNC_ASYNC_PF_FUNC_ID. There are several functions defined for
+this:
+
+   * ARM_SMCCC_KVM_FUNC_ASYNC_PF_VERSION
+
+     Returns the current version of the feature, supported by the host. It is
+     made up of major, minor and revision fields. Each field is one byte in
+     length.
+
+   * ARM_SMCCC_KVM_FUNC_ASYNC_PF_SLOTS
+
+     Returns the size of the hashed GFN table. It is used by guest to set up
+     the capacity of waiting process table.
+
+   * ARM_SMCCC_KVM_FUNC_ASYNC_PF_SDEI
+   * ARM_SMCCC_KVM_FUNC_ASYNC_PF_IRQ
+
+     Used by the guest to retrieve the SDEI event and (PPI) interrupt number
+     that are configured by VMM.
+
+   * ARM_SMCCC_KVM_FUNC_ASYNC_PF_ENABLE
+
+     Used by the guest to enable or disable the feature on the specific vCPU.
+     The argument is made up of shared buffer and flags. The shared buffer
+     is written by host to indicate the reason about the delivered asynchronous
+     page fault and token (sequence number) to identify that. There are two
+     flags are supported: KVM_ASYNC_PF_ENABLED is used to enable or disable
+     the feature. KVM_ASYNC_PF_SEND_ALWAYS allows to deliver page-not-present
+     notification regardless of the guest's state. Otherwise, the notification
+     is delivered only when the guest is in user mode.
+
+   * ARM_SMCCC_KVM_FUNC_ASYNC_PF_IRQ_ACK
+
+     Used by the guest to acknowledge the completion of page-ready notification.
