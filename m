I wouldn't have thought making migration fail if/when the host upgrades
to a new version would be particularly helpful - we'd want to provide
backwards compatibility. In particular for the suspend/resume case (I
want to be able to save my VM to disk, upgrade the host kernel and then
resume the VM).

The only potential issue I see is the implicit "version=0 if not
specified". That seems solvable by rejecting setting the stolen time
base address if no version has been specified and the host kernel
doesn't support version=0.

True - a dedicated memslot for stolen time wouldn't be great if a VM is
needing to fault pages (which would obviously be in a different
memslot). I don't have a good idea of the overhead of missing in the
lru_slot cache. The main reason I stopped using a dedicated cache was
because I discovered that my initial implementation using
kvm_write_guest_offset_cached() (which wasn't single-copy atomic safe)
was actually failing to use the cache because the buffer crossed a page
boundary (see __kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init()). So switching away from the
"_cached" variant was actually avoiding the extra walks of the memslots.

I can look at reintroducing the caching for kvm_put_guest().

Without knowing why we need it it's hard to justify what should go in
the bindings. But the idea of having the hypercalls is that the
description is returned via hypercalls rather than explicitly in
DT/ACPI. In theory we wouldn't need the hypercalls if it was fully
described in DT/ACPI.
