Hi Marc,

Thanks for your quick reply.

Guest serial does not response anymore and guest network shutdown.

Yes, it can support maximum of 32 msi interrupts, and vf driver only use 3 msi.

function calls:
--> vfio_msi_set_vector_signal
   --> irq_bypass_register_producer
      -->__connect

in __connect, add_producer finally calls kvm_vgic_v4_set_forwarding and fails to
get the 4th mapping. When add_producer fail, it does not call cons->start, calls
kvm_arch_irq_bypass_start and then kvm_arm_resume_guest.

Thanks,
Shaokun
