If we skipped the dcache maintenance on unmap, when the the dirty page is later reclaimed
the clean+stale lines are written back to the file. File-backed dirty pages will stick
around in the page cache in the hope someone else needs them.

This would happen for a guest:device-mapping that is written to, but is actually backed by
a mmap()d file. I think the EFI flash emulation does exactly this.

This was a half thought-through special case of the above. The sequence would be:

VM-A and VM-B both share a mapping of $page.

1. VM-A writes to $page through a device mapping
2. The kernel unmaps $page from VM-A for swap. KVM does the maintenance

3. VM-B writes to $page through a device mapping
4. VM-B exits, KVM skips the maintenance, $page may have clean+stale lines

5. Swap finds no further mappings, and writes $page and its clean+stale lines to disk.

Two VMs with a shared mapping is the 'easy' example. I think you just need a second
mapping for this to happen: it means the page isn't really free after the VM has exited.



Thanks,

James
