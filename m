Yes, we do need an ISB to make sure we don't start profiling using the EL2&0
translation regime, but with a buffer pointer programmed by the host at EL1 which
is most likely not even mapped at EL2.

When I wrote the patch, I reasoned that the ISB in
__sysreg_restore_state_nvhe->__sysreg_restore_el1_state and the isb from
__load_stage2 will make sure that PMSCR_EL1 is cleared before the change to the
buffer owning regime.

As I was double checking that just now, I realized that *both* ISBs are executed
only if the system has ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_AT. No ISB gets executed when
the workaround is not needed. We could make the ISB here depend on the system not
having the workaround, but it looks to me like there's little to be gained from
that (just one less ISB when the workaround is applied), at the expense of making
the code even more difficult to reason about.

My preference would be to drop this patch.

Thanks,

Alex
