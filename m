Hi Drew,

Thanks for having another look!

That looks much nicer and concise, and I prefer it to my approach.

However, I believe it requires a certain version of bash to work. On bash 5.1.4
and 4.3.48 (copyright says it's from 2013), it works as expected. On bash 3.2.57
(version used by MacOS), the result of the command is that the variable name
contains the string with the comma replaced by space, and the other variables are
empty. Using cut works with this version. According to the copyright notice, bash
3.2.57 is from 2007, so extremely old.

Did some googling for the query "bash split string" and according to this stack
overflow question [1] (second reply), using IFS works for bash >= 4.2. Don't know
how accurate it is.

I guess the question here is how compatible we want to be with regard to the bash
version. I am not familiar with bash programming, so I will defer to your decision.

That's a good idea.

Another great suggestion. The pattern above doesn't take into account character
case and the fact that 0xa is a valid number, but a is not. Best I could come up
with is:

[[ $addr =~ ^0(x|X)[0-9a-fA-F]+$ ]] || [[ $addr =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]

What do you think?

Thanks,

Alex
