Note that these days storage is as fast or even faster that many types of networking,
and that there also are opportunities for acceleration (like p2p pci dma) that also are more
natural to do in the kernel.

io-uring is actually not about moving everything to userspace IMHO, but rather the opposite,
it allows the userspace to access the kernel block subsystem in very efficent way which
is the right thing to do.

Sadly it doesn't help much with fast NVME virtualization because the bottleneck moves
to the communication with the guest.

I guess this is getting offtopic, so I won't continue this discussion here,
I just wanted to voice my opinion on this manner.

Another thing that comes to my mind (not that it has to be done in the kernel),
is that AMD's AVIC allows peer to peer interrupts between guests, and that
can in theory allow to run a 'driver' in a special guest and let it communicate
with a normal guest using interrupts bi-directionally which can finally solve the
need to waste a core in a busy wait loop.

The only catch is that the 'special guest' has to run 100% of the time,
thus it can't still share a core with other kernel/usespace tasks, but at least it can be in sleeping
state most of the time, and it can itsel run various tasks that serve various needs.

In other words, I don't have any objection to allowing part of the host kernel to run in VMX/SVM
guest mode. This can be a very intersting thing.

Best regards,
	Maxim Levitsky
