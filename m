If you think "normal" == "normal System RAM", that's wrong; see below.

pfn_valid() means "there is a struct page"; if you do pfn_to_page() and 
touch the page, you won't fault. So Anshuman's commit is correct.

pfn_to_online_page() means, "there is a struct page and it's system RAM 
that's in use; the memmap has a sane content"
