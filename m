Hi Sean,

How about merging both proposals and turn @mode into a struct and pass
around a pointer to it? Then, when calling something that requires @mode,
if @mode is NULL, the called function would use vm_arch_default_mode()
to get a pointer to the arch-specific default mode struct. If a test needs
to modify the parameters then it can construct a mode struct from scratch
or start with a copy of the default. As long as all members of the struct
representing parameters, such as backing type, have defaults mapped to
zero for the struct members, then we shouldn't be adding any burden to
users that don't care about other parameters (other than ensuring their
@mode struct was zero initialized).

Thanks,
drew
