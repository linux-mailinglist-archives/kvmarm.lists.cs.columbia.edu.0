The CONFIG_HOLES_IN_ZONE name is misleading as actually pfn_valid_within()
is only required for holes within a MAX_ORDER_NR_PAGES blocks (see comment
near pfn_valid_within() definition in mmzone.h). The freeing of the memory
map during boot avoids breaking MAX_ORDER blocks and the holes for which
memory map is freed are always aligned at MAX_ORDER.

AFAIU, the only case when there could be a hole in a MAX_ORDER block is
when EFI/ACPI reserves memory for its use and this memory becomes NOMAP in
the kernel. We still create struct pages for this memory, but they never
get values other than defaults, so core mm has no idea that this memory
should be touched, hence the need for pfn_valid_within() aliased to
pfn_valid() on arm64.

Right, pfn_valid() will return true for all memory, including
MEMBLOCK_NOMAP. Since core mm deals with PageResrved() for memory used by
the firmware, e.g. on x86, I don't see why it won't work on arm64.
