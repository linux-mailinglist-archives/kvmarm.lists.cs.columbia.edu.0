Which is why using DBM as a way to implement dirty-logging doesn't work.
Forcing the vcpu to take faults in order to update the dirty bitmap
has the benefit of (a) telling you exactly what page has been written 
to,
(b) *slowing the vcpu down*.

See? no additional read, better convergence ratio because you are not
trying to catch up with a vcpu running wild. You are in control of the
dirtying rate, not the vcpu, and the information you get requires no
extra work (just set the corresponding bit in the dirty bitmap).

Honestly, I think you are looking at the problem the wrong way.
DBM at S2 is not a solution to anything, because the information is
way too sparse, and  it doesn't solve the real problem, which is
the tracking of dirty pages caused by devices.

As I said twice before, I will not consider these patches without
a solution to the DMA problem, and I don't think DBM is part of
that solution.

Thanks,

         M.
