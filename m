More idle thoughts on this:

Although the definition of SYSTEM_SUSPEND is very simple from a PSCI
perspective, I don't think it is that simple at the system level,
because PSCI is only concerned with the CPU.

For example, what is a wake-up event? My first approach would be to
consider interrupts to be such events. However, this approach suffers
from at least two issues:

- How do you define which interrupts are actual wake-up events?
  Nothing in the GIC architecture defines what a wake-up is (let alone
  a wake-up event).

- Assuming you have a way to express the above, how do you handle
  wake-ups from interrupts that have their source in the kernel (such
  as timers, irqfd sources)? How do you cope with directly injected
  interrupts?

It looks to me that your implementation can only work with userspace
provided events, which is pretty limited.

Other items worth considering: ongoing DMA, state of the caches at
suspend time, device state in general All of this really needs to be
defined before we can move forward with this feature.

Thanks,

	M.
