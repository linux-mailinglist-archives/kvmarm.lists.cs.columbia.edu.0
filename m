In general, these pseudo-registers are reserved non-architectural
register spaces, currently being used to represent KVM-as-a-firmware's
versioning across guests' migrations [1]. That is, the user-space
configures these registers for the guests to see same 'firmware'
versions before and after migrations. The model is built over the
existing KVM_GET_REG_LIST and KVM_[SET|GET]_ONE_REG APIs. Since this
series' efforts falls into the same realm, the idea was keep this
consistent with the existing model to which VMMs (such as QEMU) are
already used to.

Granted, even though these registers should technically be immutable,
there was no similar protection employed for the existing
psuedo-registers. I was wondering if that could be of any value if we
start providing one; But I guess not, since it may break the
user-space's expectations of KVM (and probably why we didn't have it
earlier).

Raghavendra
