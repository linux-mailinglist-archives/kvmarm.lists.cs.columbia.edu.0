The first two patches are fixes for stuff I found while working on patch
#3.

Patch #3 ("configure: Make the --target option available to all
architectures") was suggested by Drew when he reviewed my series to add
support to run_tests.sh for kvmtool [1] (kvmtool can only be used to run
the arm/arm64 tests). With this patch, now all architecture have --target
as a configure option, with the only valid value being "qemu" (with the
exception of arm and arm64, of course). This was suggested by Drew for two
reasons:

* There's a possibility that kvm-unit-tests will get support for other VMMs
  in the future (his example was Rust VMM).

* The changes to the scripts to support kvmtool were rather awkward, as
  testing the value of $TARGET was some of the time accompanied by testing
  the value of $ARCH.

I renamed --target-efi to --efi-payload in the last patch because I felt it
looked rather confusing to do ./configure --target=qemu --target-efi when
configuring the tests. If the rename is not acceptable, I can think of a
few other options:

1. Rename --target to --vmm. That was actually the original name for the
option, but I changed it because I thought --target was more generic and
that --target=efi would be the way going forward to compile kvm-unit-tests
to run as an EFI payload. I realize now that separating the VMM from
compiling kvm-unit-tests to run as an EFI payload is better, as there can
be multiple VMMs that can run UEFI in a VM. Not many people use kvmtool as
a test runner, so I think the impact on users should be minimal.

2. Keep both option as they are. Personally, I think that would be
confusing to the end user, but I don't have a strong opinion against it.
