The complexity mainly comes from the fact that this thing runs concurrently
with itself without synchronization on the fast-path. Coupled with the
need to use the same ASID for all threads of a task, you end up in fiddly
situations where rollover can occur on one CPU whilst another CPU is trying
to schedule a thread of a task that already has threads running in
userspace.

However, it's architecture-specific whether or not you care about that
scenario.

You will want a separate allocator for that:

I'm not sure I agree. x86, for example, is better off using a different
algorithm for allocating its PCIDs.

If you require all threads of the same process to have the same ASID, then
that patch looks broken to me.
