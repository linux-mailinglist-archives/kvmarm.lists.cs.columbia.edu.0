It would match what we have for A53 and A57, so in that case it sounds
reasonable. OTOH, it may cause headaches when we want to finally say that
CPU models work, because it won't be clear to a user that just using
'-cpu cortex-a72' will really work, or just work on an A72 hosts like
before. We'll have that problem with A53 and A57 too, but maybe we
shouldn't add any more.

Actually, I think the failing for the wrong hardware is about all these
older targets do. I didn't look real closely, but I think all targets
produce the same result for the guest, which is to pass through the host
ID registers.
