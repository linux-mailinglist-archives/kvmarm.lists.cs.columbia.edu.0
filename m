I agree with your point in GIC aspect. It will mess up things if it makes

GIC resource hotpluggable in qemu. But it also would be better that vmm

only startup limited vcpu thread resource.

How about:

1. qemu only starts only N vcpu thread (-smp N, maxcpus=M)

2. qemu reserves the GIC resource with maxium M vcpu number

3. when qmp cmd cpu hotplug-add is triggerred, send a GED event to guest kernel

4. guest kernel recv it and trigger the acpi plug process.

Currently ACPI_CPU_HOTPLUG is enabled for Kconfig but completely not workable.
