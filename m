FWIW: right now we don't have any implementations that support ASIDs, so we're
really not ready to make these sort of decisions because we just don't know
what systems are going to look like.  While it's a fun intellectual exercise to
try to design an allocator that would work acceptably on systems of various
shapes, there's no way to test this for performance or correctness right now so
I wouldn't be comfortable taking anything.  If you're really interested, the
right place to start is the RTL

    https://github.com/chipsalliance/rocket-chip/blob/master/src/main/scala/rocket/TLB.scala#L19

This is essentially the same problem we have for our spinlocks -- maybe start
with the TLB before doing a whole new pipeline, though :)
