Interesting. So you have added NV support to QEMU? Please be aware that
the userspace side is pretty incomplete and subject to changes.

Hmm. Ok. This doesn't really answer my question in terms of what other
features the CPU has that would be affected by NV, but I guess that's
all we'll get at this point.

Thanks,
