It probably doesn't show on a modern box, but some of the slower
systems might see it. Overall, this is a design decision to keep
the translation cache as simple and straightforward as possible:
if anything affects the output of the cache, we invalidate it,
and that's it.

Yes, good point. We could unmap the VPE from all ITS, which would result
in all translations to be discarded, but this has the really bad side
effect of *also* preventing the delivery of vSGIs, which isn't what
you'd expect.

Overall, I don't think there is a good way to support this, and maybe
we should just prevent EnableLPIs to be turned off when using direct
injection. After all, the architecture does allow that for GICv3
implementations, which is what we emulate.

Thanks,
