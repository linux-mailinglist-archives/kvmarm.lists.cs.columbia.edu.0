Yup, that's it. You also get two whole bytes of room in PMBSR_EL1.MSS
which is also IMP DEF, so we could even stick some ASCII in there to
tell the guest how we really feel! :-P

I agree with you that PMBSR_EL1.DL=1 is the right call for this. With
that, I'd be surprised if there was a guest that tried to pull some
tricks other than blowing away the profile. The other option that I
find funny is if we plainly report the S2 abort to the guest, but that
wont work well when nested comes into the picture.
