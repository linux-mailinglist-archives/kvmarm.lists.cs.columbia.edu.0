Given the amount of spam I'm dealing with on the Columbia list,
I'm tempted to say "real soon now".

I'll repeat my call for migration again next week, give it another
week, then ask Konstantin to switch the archives over to the new
list. This can take up to a week, but as soon as it is done,
I'll place the list under full moderation and ask Columbia to
kill it.

So it looks like we're looking at a ~2 week deadline. Should anyone
object to this plan, shout now!

Thanks,

         M.
