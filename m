Hi Marc,

If I got this right, the AIC doesn't implement/ignores the ICH_LR_EL2.HW bit. Does
it mean that the CPU IF behaves as if HW = 0b0, meaning it asserts a maintenance
interrupt on virtual interrupt deactivation when ICH_LR_EL2.EOI = 0b1? I assume
that's the case, just double checking.

I am wondering what would happen if we come across an interrupt controller where
the CPU IF cannot assert a maintenance interrupt at all and we rely on the EOI bit
to take us out of the guest to deactivate the HW interrupt. I have to say that it
looks a bit strange to start relying on the maintenance interrupt to emulate
interrupt deactivate for hardware interrupts, but at the same timer allowing an
interrupt controller without a maintenance interrupt.

Other than that, this idea sounds like the best thing to do considering the
circumstances, I certainly can't think of anything better.

IMO, since this means we're going to rely even more on the maintenance interrupt
(not just for software emulation of level sensitive interrupts), I think there
should be some sort of dependency on having something that resembles a working
maintenance interrupt.

Thanks,

Alex
