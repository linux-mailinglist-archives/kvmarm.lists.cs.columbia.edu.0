Yes, I-cache coherency is what I had missed! So without a S2 unmapping
on reboot, if there's any stale and "valid" cache line in the I-cache,
guest may fetch the wrong instructions directly from it, and bad things
will happen... (We will otherwise get a translation fault and a
permission fault and invalidate the I-cache as needed.)

Thanks for the head up and Marc's fix!


Thanks both,
