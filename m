Hey Paolo,

Yeah, great question, I had actually alluded to this on [02/10] in
talking to Marc about this.

Really the issue we want to avoid is sampling the host counter twice,
which at least based on the existing means of counter migration is
impossible as the VMM must account for elapsed time. Maxim's patches
appear to address that very issue as well.

Perhaps this will clarify the motivation for my approach: what if the
kernel wasn't the authoritative source for wall time in a system?
Furthermore, VMMs may wish to define their own heuristics for counter
migration (e.g. we only allow the counter to 'jump' by X seconds
during migration blackout). If a VMM tried to assert its whims on the
TSC state before handing it down to the kernel, we would inadvertently
be sampling the host counter twice again. And, anything can happen
between the time we assert elapsed time is within SLO and KVM
computing the TSC offset (scheduling, L0 hypervisor preemption).

So, Maxim's changes would address my concerns in the general case, but
maybe not as much in edge cases where an operator may make decisions
about how much time can elapse while the guest hasn't had CPU time.

Oliver
