The usual answer here is that the kernel is not in favor of adding
in-kernel functionality that is not used in the upstream kernel.  If
you come up with a real use case, and that use case is GPL and has
plans for upstreaming, and that use case has a real benefit
(dramatically faster than user code could likely be, does something
new and useful, etc), then it may well be mergeable.
