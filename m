Right. I think I missed that last bit (and Alex's email at the same 
time).

I'd rather this is done in perf_aux_output_end(), as a full blown DSB 
ISH
on guest entry is pretty harsh... It would also nicely split the 
responsibilities:

- KVM stops SPE and make sure the output is drained
- Perf makes the data visible to all CPUs

Thoughts?
