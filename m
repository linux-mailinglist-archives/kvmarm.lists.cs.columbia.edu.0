We have had that discussion before (around version 2 of this series,
if I remember well).

No, that's not the way this is supposed to work. These hypercalls are
of course global, even if the accessor is per-vcpu. This is similar to
tons of other things, such as some of the PMU data, the timer virtual
offset... the list goes on. If that's not what this code does, then it
is a bug and it needs to be fixed.

Yes, we all understand that. My response to that was (and still is):

- There is no need to invent a new userspace interface. The one we
  have is terrible enough, and we don't need another square wheel that
  would need to be maintained beside the existing one.

- Let's say we have 1024 new pseudo-registers, 1024 vcpus, 64bit regs:
  that's 8MB worth of extra data. This is not insignificant, but also
  not really a problem given that such a large VM is probably attached
  to a proportionally large amount of memory. In practice, we're
  talking of less than 10 registers, and less than 100 vcpus. A crazy
  8kB at most. Who cares?

- If this is eventually deemed to be a *real* scalability problem, we
  can always expose a map of registers that are global, and let
  userspace know that it can elide the rest. Problem solved, backward
  compatibility preserved. And I'm willing to bet that we won't need
  it in my lifetime.

Thanks,

	M.
