So you are assuming that a cache line is at most 64 bytes.
It is actualy implementation defined, and you can probe for it
by looking at the CTR_EL0 register. There are implementations
ranging from 32 to 256 bytes in the wild, and let's not mention
broken big-little implementations here.

I really wish this was relying on an architected exception delivery
mechanism that can be blocked by the guest itself (PSTATE.{I,F,A}).
Trying to guess based on the PC won't fly. But these signals are
pretty hard to multiplex with anything else. Like any form of
non-architected exception injection, I don't see a good path forward
unless we start considering something like SDEI.
