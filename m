Introduce a paravirtualization interface for KVM/arm64 based on the
"Arm Paravirtualized Time for Arm-Base Systems" specification DEN 0057A.

This only adds the details about "Stolen Time" as the details of "Live
Physical Time" have not been fully agreed.

User space can specify a reserved area of memory for the guest and
inform KVM to populate the memory with information on time that the host
kernel has stolen from the guest.

A hypercall interface is provided for the guest to interrogate the
hypervisor's support for this interface and the location of the shared
memory structures.

+Paravirtualized time support for arm64
+======================================
+
+Arm specification DEN0057/A defines a standard for paravirtualised time
+support for AArch64 guests:
+
+https://developer.arm.com/docs/den0057/a
+
+KVM/arm64 implements the stolen time part of this specification by providing
+some hypervisor service calls to support a paravirtualized guest obtaining a
+view of the amount of time stolen from its execution.
+
+Two new SMCCC compatible hypercalls are defined:
+
+* PV_TIME_FEATURES: 0xC5000020
+* PV_TIME_ST:       0xC5000021
+
+These are only available in the SMC64/HVC64 calling convention as
+paravirtualized time is not available to 32 bit Arm guests. The existence of
+the PV_FEATURES hypercall should be probed using the SMCCC 1.1 ARCH_FEATURES
+mechanism before calling it.
+
+PV_TIME_FEATURES
+    ============= ========    ==========
+    Function ID:  (uint32)    0xC5000020
+    PV_call_id:   (uint32)    The function to query for support.
+                              Currently only PV_TIME_ST is supported.
+    Return value: (int64)     NOT_SUPPORTED (-1) or SUCCESS (0) if the relevant
+                              PV-time feature is supported by the hypervisor.
+    ============= ========    ==========
+
+PV_TIME_ST
+    ============= ========    ==========
+    Function ID:  (uint32)    0xC5000021
+    Return value: (int64)     IPA of the stolen time data structure for this
+                              VCPU. On failure:
+                              NOT_SUPPORTED (-1)
+    ============= ========    ==========
+
+The IPA returned by PV_TIME_ST should be mapped by the guest as normal memory
+with inner and outer write back caching attributes, in the inner shareable
+domain. A total of 16 bytes from the IPA returned are guaranteed to be
+meaningfully filled by the hypervisor (see structure below).
+
+PV_TIME_ST returns the structure for the calling VCPU.
+
+Stolen Time
+-----------
+
+The structure pointed to by the PV_TIME_ST hypercall is as follows:
+
++-------------+-------------+-------------+----------------------------+
+| Field       | Byte Length | Byte Offset | Description                |
++=============+=============+=============+============================+
+| Revision    |      4      |      0      | Must be 0 for version 1.0  |
++-------------+-------------+-------------+----------------------------+
+| Attributes  |      4      |      4      | Must be 0                  |
++-------------+-------------+-------------+----------------------------+
+| Stolen time |      8      |      8      | Stolen time in unsigned    |
+|             |             |             | nanoseconds indicating how |
+|             |             |             | much time this VCPU thread |
+|             |             |             | was involuntarily not      |
+|             |             |             | running on a physical CPU. |
++-------------+-------------+-------------+----------------------------+
+
+All values in the structure are stored little-endian.
+
+The structure will be updated by the hypervisor prior to scheduling a VCPU. It
+will be present within a reserved region of the normal memory given to the
+guest. The guest should not attempt to write into this memory. There is a
+structure per VCPU of the guest.
+
+For the user space interface see Documentation/virt/kvm/devices/vcpu.txt
+section "3. GROUP: KVM_ARM_VCPU_PVTIME_CTRL".
