Good point - I think I can fix that with a couple more static inline
functions... It's a little tricky due to header file include order, but
I think I can make it work.

Umm... this is me screwing up the locking...

The current code is very confused about which locks should/can be held
when kvm_update_stolen_time() is called. vcpu_req_record_steal()
explicitly takes the kvm->srcu read lock - which is then taken again
here. But kvm_hypercall_stolen_time doesn't hold any lock. And obviously
at some point in time I expected this to be called in atomic context...

In general the page is likely to be faulted in (as a guest which is
using stolen time is surely looking at the numbers there). But there's
no need for the pagefault_disable(). It also shouldn't be the callers
responsibility to hold kvm->srcu.
