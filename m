reset_pmcr() is called from kvm_reset_vcpu()->kvm_reset_sys_regs(). Before calling
kvm_reset_sys_regs(), kvm_reset_vcpu() returns -EINVAL if the VCPU has the PMUv3
feature but the host doesn't have a PMU.

It looks to me like the undef can happen only when the VCPU feature isn't set and
the hardware doesn't have a PMU. How about we change the test to check for
kvm_vcpu_has_pmu() to avoid executing the extra instructions, which are not needed
because the VM won't have a PMU?

On the other hand, kvm_pmu_vcpu_reset() is happy to do the reset even if the VCPU
feature isn't set, the host doesn't support a PMU, and before PMCR_EL0 is
initialized. It's up to you, the kvm_arm_support_pmu_v3() check looks consistent
with how PMU reset is handled.

Thanks,
Alex
