Thanks for this. In future, please Cc me and Will on email addresses
we can actually read.

Surely there is a way to conditionally trap SPE registers, right? You
should still be able to do this if SPE is not configured for a given
guest (as we do for other feature such as PtrAuth).

Really? How can the guest receive a stage-2 fault? This doesn't fit 
what
I understand of the ARMv8 exception model. Or do you mean a SPE 
interrupt
describing a S2 fault?

And this is not just pinning the memory either. You have to ensure that
all S2 page tables are created ahead of SPE being able to DMA to guest
memory. This may have some impacts on the THP code...

I'll have a look at the actual series ASAP (but that's not very soon).

Thanks,

         M.
