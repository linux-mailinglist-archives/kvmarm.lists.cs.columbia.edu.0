You ideally want to get the host overhead for a VM to as little as you 
can. I'm not terribly fond of the idea of reserving a full page just 
because we're too afraid of having the guest donate memory.

I wouldn't call "quiesce a device" much more tricky. We have to do that 
for other devices as well today.

Why would FW care?

Just define the interface to always require natural alignment when 
donating a memory location?

If you really do suffer from put_user(), there are alternatives. You 
could just map the page on the registration hcall and then leave it 
pinned until the vcpu gets destroyed again.

I really don't understand the problem with kexec cancellation. Worst 
case, let guest FW set it up for you and propagate only the address down 
via ACPI/DT. That way you can mark the respective memory as reserved too.

But even with a Linux only mechanism, just take a look at 
arch/x86/kernel/kvmclock.c. All they do to remove the map is to hook 
into machine_crash_shutdown() and machine_shutdown().
