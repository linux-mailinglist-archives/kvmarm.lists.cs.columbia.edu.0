I think (well, I haven't re-checked), an mprotect() in the VMM ends up
calling set_pte_at_notify() which would call kvm_set_spte_gfn() and that
will map the page in the guest. So the problem only appears between
different VMMs sharing the same page. In principle they can be
MAP_PRIVATE but they'd be CoW so the race wouldn't matter. So it's left
with MAP_SHARED between multiple VMMs.

I think we should just state that this is unsafe and they can delete
each-others tags. If we are really worried, we can export that lock you
added in mte.c.
