The end goal of this series is to strip down the interface between common
KVM code and arch specific code so that there is precisely one arch hook
for creating a vCPU and one hook for destroying a vCPU.  In addition to
cleaning up the code base, simplifying the interface gives architectures
more freedom to organize their vCPU creation code.  Details below.

v2:
  - Rebase to commit e41a90be9659 ("KVM: x86/mmu: WARN if root_hpa is
    invalid when handling a page fault").  A few minor x86 (VMX) conflicts,
    and one straightforward arm conflict with commit 8564d6372a7d ("KVM:
    arm64: Support stolen time reporting via shared structure") in patch
    "KVM: ARM: Move all vcpu init code into kvm_arch_vcpu_create()".
  - Collect Reviews and Acks [Christoffer, Greg].
  - Fix a warning in "KVM: arm64: Free sve_state via arm specific hook"
    by using a "void" return type [Christoffer].
  - Fix a bug in "KVM: PPC: Move kvm_vcpu_init() invocation to common code"
    where the call in kvmppc_core_vcpu_create_e500mc() was inadvertantly
    left behind.


KVM's vCPU creation code is comically messy.  kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu()
calls three separate arch hooks: init(), create() and setup().  The init()
call is especially nasty as it's hidden away in a common KVM function,
kvm_init_vcpu(), that for all intents and purposes must be immediately
invoked after the vcpu object is allocated.

Not to be outdone, vCPU destruction also has three arch hooks: uninit(),
destroy() and free(), the latter of which isn't actually invoked by common
KVM code, but the hook declaration still exists because architectures are
relying on its forward declaration.

Eliminating the extra arch hooks is relatively straightforward, just
tedious.  For the most part, there is no fundamental constraint that
necessitated the proliferation of arch hooks, rather they crept in over
time, usually when x86-centric code was moved out of generic KVM and into
x86 code.

E.g. kvm_arch_vcpu_setup() was added to allow x86 to do vcpu_load(), which
can only be done after preempt_notifier initialization, but adding setup()
overlooked the fact that the preempt_notifier was only initialized after
kvm_arch_vcpu_create() because preemption support was added when x86's MMU
setup (the vcpu_load() user) was called from common KVM code.

For all intents and purposes, there is no true functional change in this
series.  The order of some allocations will change, and a few memory leaks
are fixed, but the actual functionality of a guest should be unaffected.

Patches 01-03 are bug fixes in error handling paths that were found by
inspection when refactoring the associated code.

Patches 04-43 refactor each arch implementation so that the unwanted arch
hooks can be dropped without a functional change, e.g. move code out of
kvm_arch_vcpu_setup() so that all implementations are empty, then drop the
functions and caller.

Patches 44-45 are minor clean up to eliminate kvm_vcpu_uninit().

The net result is to go from this:

        vcpu = kvm_arch_vcpu_create(kvm, id);
               |
               |-> kvm_vcpu_init()
                   |
                   |-> kvm_arch_vcpu_init()

        if (IS_ERR(vcpu)) {
                r = PTR_ERR(vcpu);
                goto vcpu_decrement;
        }

        preempt_notifier_init(&vcpu->preempt_notifier, &kvm_preempt_ops);

        r = kvm_arch_vcpu_setup(vcpu);
        if (r)
                goto vcpu_destroy;
