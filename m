You're right. I haven't explained this in the patch series or provided
enough context other than a link to Will's presentation [1].

The idea is that protected VMs are protected from the host Linux
kernel (and from other VMs), where the host does not have access to
guest memory even if compromised. This patch series does not cover
that part yet. It is a part of, and builds on, other concurrent work
in order to get us there eventually [2].

Once everything falls into place, the host should not even have access
to a protected guest's state or anything that would enable it to
manipulate it (e.g., vcpu register context and el2 system registers),
only hyp would have that access. If the host could access that state,
then it might be able to get around the protection provided.
Therefore, anything that is sensitive and that would require such
access needs to happen at hyp, hence the code in nvhe running only at
hyp.

You're right that they don't change during the lifetime of a VM, but
protected VMs can coexist with non-protected VMs. The values of these
registers are different between the two (different trapping to control
protection as well as enabled features). Thus the new
__activate_traps_pvm(), which would activate traps specifically for
protected VMs.

Thank you,
