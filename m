Does this deal with the case where the VMAs are changed after the
memslot is created? While we can do the check here to give the VMM a
heads-up if it gets it wrong, I think we also need it in
user_mem_abort() to deal with a VMM which mmap()s over the VA of the
memslot. Or am I missing something?

But if everyone is happy with the restriction (just for KVM) of not
allowing MTE+VM_SHARED then that sounds like a good way forward.

Thanks,

Steve
