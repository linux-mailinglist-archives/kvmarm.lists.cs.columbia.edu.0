Thanks, didn't know that. I'll keep that in mind for testing.

Please keep in mind that while it works, it still needs significant changes
before it is merged.

I am leaning towards merging this patch to prevent people from seeing the
splat, and when the AArch32 ID reg series gets merged it can be reverted.
But in the end it's up to Marc to decide what he prefers.

Sure, no problem. Here's the patch, it's earlier attempt to fix NULL
pointer dereference, feel free to change change it as you see fit:

    KVM/arm64: Hide AArch32 PMU registers when not available

    Commit 11663111cd49 ("KVM: arm64: Hide PMU registers from userspace when
    not available") hid the AArch64 PMU registers from userspace and guest
    when the PMU VCPU feature was not set. Do the same when the PMU
    registers are accessed by an AArch32 guest.

    This also fixes this nasty splat which was observed on an odroid-c4, by
    running the kvm-unit-tests' pmu-cycle-counter test with kvmtool without
    an emulated PMU:

    This is caused by the fact the kvm->arch.arm_pmu is NULL when the VCPU
    feature is not set and kvm_pmu_event_mask() tries to dereference the NULL
    pointer to get at pmuver.

    Now that KVM emulates ID_DFR0 and hides the PMU from the guest when the
    feature is not set, it is safe to inject to inject an undefined exception
    when the PMU is not present, as that corresponds to the architected
    behaviour.
