It means that using FP_STATE_TASK as a value for the fp_type
member of the task struck recording what type of state is
currently stored for the task is not valid, one of the other two
values representing what was actually saved must be chosen.

we'd =3D=3D we would so work out to match the tense.

I agree that this is not an ideal interface, I am merely
following the previously chosen idiom since I haven't been able
to figure out why we were doing it in the first place and with a
lot of these things it turns out that there's some actual reason.

It's not even like fpsimd_bind_task_to_cpu() has ever been
written in terms of this function, there's two parallel
implementations.  My best guess was that it was some combination
of not peering at KVM internals and keeping struct
fpsimd_last_state_struct internal to fpsimd.c (since we're
effectively just passing one of those in in a more verbose form)
but never anything solid enough to be sure.

Yes, it probably makes it more tractable with KVM being able to
just say what type of state it wants to save so there's less to
take care of syncing with the host task so the code is a lot more
direct - it will just be a case of setting the desired fp_type
whenever a decision is made about what state type to save.
