No, handle_guest_sea() ---> ghes_notify_sea  ---> apei driver

If it is an  external abort, it will call apei driver to handle it, but it should be only SEA will call the apei driver.
other type of external abort should not call apei driver.
I am not see arch code sort all that out.

        /* Synchronous External Abort? */
        if (kvm_vcpu_dabt_isextabt(vcpu)) {
                /*
                 * For RAS the host kernel may handle this abort.
                 * There is no need to pass the error into the guest.
                 */
                if (!handle_guest_sea(fault_ipa, kvm_vcpu_get_hsr(vcpu)))
                        return 1;
         }

In some hardware platform, it supports RAS, but the RAS error address will be not recorded, so it is better to inject a data abort instead of SError for thtat platform.
because guest will try to do recovery for the Synchronous data abort, such as kill the error application. But for SError, guest will be panic.

Yes, some platform supports RAS but will not record the error address, so the host has failed to handle the error.
