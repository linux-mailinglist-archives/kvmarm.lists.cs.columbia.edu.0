You can disable the PMU with QEMU by specifying pmu=off in the -cpu
argument, among other things.

We definitely have the plumbing for exception handlers in selftests,
aarch64/debug-exceptions.c is an example. My thought was more general
+ rather lazy. For any combination of CPU features, expect that
kvm-unit-tests should either pass or skip. If they fail or blow up the
host then probably a good indicator of a KVM bug.

Thanks for the link, I'll have a peek.

Right -- I completely agree this is where we should be when AArch32
feature registers are trapped.

Seems to me all the AArch32 feature register trap logic should come
later on as there's a nonzero chance I introduced a bug :) Shall we
stop the bleeding w/ your originally proposed patch? Doesn't seem any
more objectionable than what we're already doing.

To avoid shamelessly plagiarizing: may I package up what you have
below as a commit coming from you?
