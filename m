These bits are now assigned by the latest revision of the GICv4.1 spec,
and are roughly defined as you reversed engineered them below.

The idea is that unmodified SW expects SGIs to have an active state,
because that's the way it has always been so far. Any architecturally
compliant hypervisor must implement an active state for SGIs.

Now, there are obvious benefits in having HW-accelerated SGI delivery,
which for GICv4.1 comes at the expense of loosing the active state.

So we need a way to expose the fact that the hypervisor *can* support
non-active-state SGIs (hence the GICD_TYPER2.nASSGIcap bit), and a way
for the guest to say "I'm OK with losing the active state for SGIs",
which corresponds to the GICD_CTLR.nASSGIreq bit.

Note that this isn't a property that ever needs to be exposed by the
HW, but one that has been architected for the sole benefit of
hypervisors and guests (a HW implementation would keep them as RAZ/WI).

This write-up is sensible, but it would be a duplication of the
architecture spec once it is publicly available. As much as possible,
I'd like not to duplicate information, as the are bound to diverge as
the architecture spec gets amended. How about we add this to the commit
message instead, as a placeholder until the GICv4.1 doc is available
(hopefully some time next year)?

Thanks,
