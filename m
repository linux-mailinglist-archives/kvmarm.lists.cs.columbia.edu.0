From: Suzuki K Poulose <suzuki.poulose@arm.com>

We support mapping host memory backed by PMD transparent hugepages
at stage2 as huge pages. However the checks are now spread across
two different places. Let us unify the handling of the THPs to
keep the code cleaner (and future proof for PUD THP support).
This patch moves transparent_hugepage_adjust() closer to the caller
to avoid a forward declaration for fault_supports_stage2_huge_mappings().

Also, since we already handle the case where the host VA and the guest
PA may not be aligned, the explicit VM_BUG_ON() is not required.
