If only arm, and no unit tests, needs the phys allocator, then it can be
integrated with whatever arm is using it for and removed from the general
lib.

If other architectures or unit tests have / could have uses for the
phys allocator then we should either document that it doesn't have
locks or keep the locks, and arm will just know that they don't work,
but also that they don't need to for its purposes.

Finally, if we drop the locks and arm doesn't have any other places where
we use locks without the MMU enabled, then we can change the lock
implementation to not have the no-mmu fallback - maybe by switching to the
generic implementation as the other architectures have done.

Thanks,
