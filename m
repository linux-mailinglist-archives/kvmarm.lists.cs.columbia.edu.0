That's an option indeed.

One reason to keep PG_mte_tagged around for normal user programs,
especially those not using MTE, is that it doesn't affect CoW. Page
copying in two separate loops (for data and tags) does affect
performance. Now, if there's no fork, you may not notice but in the
Android land with zygote, I think it will be quickly observed.

For KVM, I guess we could benchmark a dummy lock array without any MTE
hardware but I don't have a setup around where I can time multiple VMs
starting in parallel.

I agree.

My concern is that when we hit a bottleneck on that big lock (and I'm
pretty sure we will), do we have a good mitigation or we should rather
break the ABI now and disallow MAP_SHARED? The latter would need to be
done fairly soon as a fix, backported.

I think the possible workarounds are pretty good but maybe we should
also ask user-space people how important MAP_SHARED + PROT_MTE is. If
they don't use it, maybe we shouldn't bother with all this (well,
assuming there's no other race between different mms that we missed).
