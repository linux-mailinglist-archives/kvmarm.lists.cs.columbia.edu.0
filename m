Indeed. In my dream world I would land with a config where the host
and the guest have very minimal understanding of each other. How small
that can be remains to be seen..

Yes. This fooled me for a while as I was thinking it actually does the
job, but no. It was my second miss, first place I was looking at was
the ioctl call itself.

Ack.

Awesome. Took a while to understand the construction.

THANK YOU! My missing piece.

Let's see. Yes, the 'virt' host is already nicely wrapped and running.
To make this easier for starters I use 1:1 ipa:phys mapping to get one
vm (besides the host) going.
