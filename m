And again, I disagree. This API has *nothing* to do with the ITS. It
is completely general purpose and should work with anything because it
is designed for that.

The problem is that you're considering that RING+BITMAP is a different
thing from BITMAP alone when it comes to non-CPU traffic. It really
isn't.  We can't say "there will only be a few pages dirtied", because
we simply don't know.

If you really want a quantitative argument then say something like:

"The use of the ring+bitmap combination is only beneficial if there is
only very little memory that is dirtied by non-CPU agents. Consider
using the stand-alone bitmap API if this isn't the case."

which clearly puts the choice in the hand of the user.

Peter said there is an undefined behaviour. I want to understand
whether this is the case or not. QEMU is only one of the users of this
stuff, as all the vendors have their own custom VMM, and they do
things in funny ways.
