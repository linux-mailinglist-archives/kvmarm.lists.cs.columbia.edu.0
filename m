The architecture is not prescriptive here, the behaviour is
"unpredictable". It could mean tags read-as-zero/write-ignored or an
SError.

OK, so that's where we could kill the guest if the VMM doesn't play
nicely. It means that we need the check when setting up the stage 2
entry. I guess it's fine if we only have the check at that point and
ignore it on KVM_SET_USER_MEMORY_REGION. It would be nice if we returned
on error on slot setup but we may not know (yet) whether the VMM intends
to enable MTE for the guest.

What we need to avoid is a malicious VMM affecting the host kernel. If
the VMM wants to corrupt the guest, I think it has other ways already
even without MTE.
