Thanks for taking a look and the rebase. I will remove the pinned stuff
in the next revision as that was added just to compare against the previous
version.

Hmm..not sure I quite follow that. As per the current logic vmid 0 is
reserved and is not allocated to Guest.

I think this is more related to the "pinned vmid" stuff and was borrowed from
the asid_update_limit() fn in arch/arm64/mm/context.c. But I missed the
comment that explains the reason behind it. It says,

---x---
	/*
	 * There must always be an ASID available after rollover. Ensure that,
	 * even if all CPUs have a reserved ASID and the maximum number of ASIDs
	 * are pinned, there still is at least one empty slot in the ASID map.
	 */
	max_pinned_asids = num_available_asids - num_possible_cpus() - 2;
---x---

So this is to make sure we will have at least one VMID available after rollover
in case we have pinned the max number of VMIDs. I will include that comment
to make it clear.

Thanks,
Shameer
