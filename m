kvm_pmu_set_counter_event_type() uses the number of events to mask out the
unsupported events, so still depends on pmuver.

But I understand what you are saying, there might be differences between what
exactly an event is counting, how it increments and how the counter value should
be interpreted based on the microarchitecture.

Ok, so any kind of asymmetry is unacceptable.

Accepted behaviour:

1. If userspace sets PMU for one VCPU, then *all* other VCPUs must have a PMU
set, and furthermore, it must be the same PMU as the first VCPU,

or

2. If userspace has initialized a PMU (via
KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_CTRL(KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_INIT)) without setting a PMU, then
it is forbidden for userspace to set a PMU for the other VCPUs.

Is that what you had in mind?

I was talking in the context of allowing userspace to associate different PMUs
to different VCPUs.
