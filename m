Yep, we should avoid to visit and modify this function when a new PSCI call
is added. I intended not to introduce new macros, especially in the header
file (include/linux/arm-smccc.h), which is out of kvm/arm64 scope to some
degree. However, these newly added macros will have life much easier. I will
include the changes in next respin.

Ok. Lets filter these SMCCC PSCI numbers in kvm_hvc_call_handler():

     /* Filter these calls that aren't documented in the specification */
     if (func >= KVM_PSCI_FN_CPU_SUSPEND && func <= KVM_PSCI_FN_MIGRATE)
         return kvm_psci_call(vcpu);

     switch (ARM_SMCCC_OWNER_NUM(func)) {
         :
     }

Thanks,
Gavin
