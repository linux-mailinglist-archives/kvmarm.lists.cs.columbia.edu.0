int arm/unittests.cfg

there are tests related to TCG that are commented.

# Test PMU support (TCG) with -icount IPC=256
#[pmu-tcg-icount-256]
#file = pmu.flat
#extra_params = -icount 8 -append 'cycle-counter 256'
#groups = pmu
#accel = tcg

I wondered why we kept those and commented. Should we start with
separate tests for KVM and TCG?

Yes I can definitively fix that
