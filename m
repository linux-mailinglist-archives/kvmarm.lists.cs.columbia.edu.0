The series gives userspace the ability to modify the guest's
perception of the TSC in whatever way it sees fit. The algorithm in
the documentation provides a suggestion to userspace on how to do
exactly that. I kept that advancement logic out of the kernel because
IMO it is an implementation detail: users have differing opinions on
how clocks should behave across a migration and KVM shouldn't have any
baked-in rules around it.

At the same time, userspace can choose to _not_ jump the TSC and use
the available interfaces to just migrate the existing state of the
TSCs.

When I had initially proposed this series upstream, Paolo astutely
pointed out that there was no good way to get a (CLOCK_REALTIME, TSC)
pairing, which is critical for the TSC advancement algorithm in the
documentation. Google's best way to get (CLOCK_REALTIME, TSC) exists
in userspace [1], hence the missing kvm clock changes. So, in all, the
spirit of the KVM clock changes is to provide missing UAPI around the
clock/TSC, with the side effect of changing the guest-visible value.

Hopefully the above explanation made it clearer how the TSCs are
supposed to get advanced, and why it isn't done in the kernel.

Yeah, sounds good to me. Shall I respin the whole series from what you
have in kvm/queue, or just send you the bits and pieces that ought to
be applied?
