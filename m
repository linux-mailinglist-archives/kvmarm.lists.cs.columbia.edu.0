I don't think this makes much sense. Why should we account interrupts
for the guest when the interrupts don't have anything to do with it?
And guess what, they almost *never* do. The only interrupt that could
be accountable to the vcpu is the vPE doorbell, and that one can never
causes an exit, by definition.

The kernel already provides quite a lot around interrupt accounting
already, and I don't think we need to do add more for the guest. If
this made any sense, it should be applicable to any userspace task,
not just vcpus.

Thanks,
