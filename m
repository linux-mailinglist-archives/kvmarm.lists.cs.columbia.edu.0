I'm afraid I don't have such hardware to test on, but this does make
sense to me based on my understanding of the behaviour of FWB.

Given we also later nuke this fit for !FWB, maybe we want to take it out
of HCR_GUEST_FLAGS and have:

	if (cpus_have_const_cap(ARM64_HAS_STAGE2_FWB))
		vcpu->arch.hcr_el2 |= HCR_FWB;
	else
		vcpu->arch.hcr_el2 |= HCR_TVM;

Either way:
