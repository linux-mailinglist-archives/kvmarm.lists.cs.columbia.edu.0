My main worry with this is that it causes overhead on the fast path.
Disabled interrupts (for whichever reason they are disabled) shouldn't
have to be evaluated on the fast path.

Take for example kvm_vgic_vcpu_pending_irq(), which we evaluate pretty
often (each time a vcpu wakes up). Do we want to scan a bunch of
group-disabled interrupts there? No.

At the end of the day, what we're looking at is a list of disabled,
pending interrupts. They can be disabled for multiple reasons
(group is disabled, or interrupt itself is disabled). But they should
*not* end-up on the AP list, because that list has a precise semantic.

Your suggestion to add the group-disabled interrupts to the AP list
may be a cool hack, but it is mostly a hack that opens the whole thing
to a bunch of corner cases. Let's not do that.

I lost track of the original approach already :-/

Try and build the above suggestion. It should follow the same flow as
the enabled, group-enabled interrupts, just with a different list.

Thanks,
