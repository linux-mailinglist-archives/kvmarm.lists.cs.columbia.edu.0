OK, that'd be assuming that we'll never see a service where version A
is incompatible with version B and that we have to exclude one or the
other. Meh. Let's cross that bridge once it is actually built.

I'd rather have that. There already is stuff that rely on things not
changing once a vcpu has run, so I'd rather be consistent.

We only have one vcpu updating this at any given time (that's what the
lock ensures). A simple write should be OK, as far as I can tell.

Thanks,
