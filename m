Since this is implementing the kernel side of an RFC userspace ABI, I'm going to
treat the series as an RFC also and not go into the individual patches.

What strikes me as odd is the fact that, as far as I can tell, you're duplicating
part of the kvm/sys_regs.c and kvm/handle_exit.c functionality in the nvhe code.
Why was this approach chosen instead of reusing the existing functions and adding
extra code to handle the protected VM case?

Another example of this is detecting when a host dropped to 32bit EL0, the comment
says that you don't trust the host to make the check. What exactly do you trust
the host to do at what point? I don't see this explained anywhere, it's possible
I've missed it.

I also think that registers that mostly don't change during the lifetime of the VM
(HCR_EL2, CPTR_EL2, MDCR_EL2) can be set by host when the VM becomes protected,
instead of fiddling with them at each world switch. Was there a particular reason
for changing them in __activate_traps_pvm() or was this just an implementation choice?

Thanks,

Alex
