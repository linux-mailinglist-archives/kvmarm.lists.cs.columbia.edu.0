Actually, there is not much difference functionally for these two solutions.
I just thought there was a bit more change relatively in v3 for the new 
page-table framework.
But I still respect your opinion, so v3 is fine enough.  :)

Thanks,

Yanan.

        Here are the reasons for my current opinion:
        <br>
        With an errno returned from the map handler for this single
        case, there
        <br>
        will be one more vcpu exit from guest and we also have to
        consider the
        <br>
        spurious dirty pages. Besides, it seems that the EAGAIN errno
        has been
        <br>
        chosen specially for this case and can not be used elsewhere for
        other
        <br>
        reasons, as we will change this errno to zero at the end of the
        function.
        <br>
        <br>
        The v1 solution looks like more concise at last, so I refine the
        diff
        <br>
        and post the v4 with two patches here, just for a contrast.
        <br>
        <br>
        Which solution will you prefer now? Could you please let me
        know.

      <br>
      I'm still very much opposed to mixing mapping and permission
      changes.
      <br>
      How bad is the spurious return to a vcpu?
