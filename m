Yes, parsing is really fast.  However, the work doesn't end at building 
an in-memory representation.  An efficient representation (and a schema 
that is negotiated in advance) makes it possible to do this work as late 
and as little as possible, instead of doing it on every fetch of the 
statistics.

For cloud vendors running virtual machines, they want to consolidate 
housekeeping tasks on as few CPUs as possible (because housekeeping CPUs 
cannot be billed to the customers), and every millisecond really counts.
ASCII is inviting, but things like Protobufs, FlatBuffers, Cap'n'Proto 
are all binary because all those hidden costs do exist.

Yes, Jing's patches can just do a quick copy_to_user if pread does not 
access the schema.  And it's very simple code too.

Well yeah, but there's still the problem of what the other side thinks. 
  In the end varlink's interesting because it's just JSON, meaning 
there's plenty of parsers available---but they all too often don't 
separate int vs. double.  We had this issue with projects talking to 
QEMU (which has been using JSON the same way as varlink for ten years or 
so) and JSON parsers returning an overflow for 2^64-1 (because it rounds 
to 2^64) or an incorrect value.  I'm not saying it's a showstopper, it's 
just an unavoidable ugliness if you pick JSON.

Yes, once we add for example histograms we would like to include in the 
schema the size and number of the buckets.

No, you're right.  The C implementations are really just very thin 
wrappers over JSON.  There's very little "Varlink"ness in them.

However the interesting part of the schema are the metadata--the unit, 
whether something is an instant vs. a cumulative value, the bucket size 
when we add histograms.  These things are obviously not included in the 
data and must be communicated separately.  Userspace tools could also 
use a schema to validate user requests ("record the halt_poll_fail_ns 
every second").

I guess you're talking about NETLINK_GENERIC, that also has the issue 
that the schema (the attributes) is not dynamic but rather part of the 
uAPI.  We explicitly don't want them to be stable, they're like 
tracepoints in that respect and that's why we took ideas from trace-cmd. 
  Anyway, as a start Jing will summarize all these discussions in v10.

Thanks,

Paolo
