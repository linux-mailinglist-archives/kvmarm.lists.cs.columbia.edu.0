I'm not quite sure about Peter's assessment here.

I agree with the inconsistency identified here: we always enumerate all
unallocated ID regs, but we enumerate ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1 conditionally.
This doesn't feel right: on a non-SVE guest, ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1 should
behave exactly as an unallocated ID register.

I'm not sure about the proposed fix.

For one thing, I'm not sure that old hosts will accept writing of 0 to
arbitrary ID regs.  This may require some digging, but commit
93390c0a1b20 ("arm64: KVM: Hide unsupported AArch64 CPU features from guests")
may be the place to start.

My original idea was that at the source end we should be conservative:
enumerate and dump the minimum set of registers relevant to the
target -- for compatibility with old hosts that don't handle the
unallocated ID regs at all.  At the destination end, modern hosts
should be permissive, i.e., allow any ID reg to be set to 0, but don't
require the setting of any reg that older source hosts might not send.

So, I think that instead of changing the ID_AA64ZFR0_EL1 behaviour,
parhaps we should move all ID_UNALLOCATED() regs (and possibly
ID_HIDDEN(), not sure about that) to have REG_HIDDEN_USER visibility.

Thoughts?
