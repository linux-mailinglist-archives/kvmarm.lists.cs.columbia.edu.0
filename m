I believe the fact that KVM is more permissive on PMUVER and DEBUGVER
than cpufeature is in fact a detail of KVM, no? read_id_reg() already
implicitly trusts the cpufeature code filtering and applies additional
limitations on top of what we get back. Similarly, there are fields
where KVM is more restrictive than cpufeature (ID_AA64DFR0_PMSVER).

Each of those constraints could theoretically be expressed as an
arm64_ftr_bits structure within KVM.

Good point. AA64DFR0 is an annoying register :)

It is certainly a matter of where you choose to draw those lines. We already
do bank on the implementation details of cpufeature.c quite heavily, its
just stuffed away behind read_sanitised_ftr_reg(). Now we have KVM bits and
pieces in cpufeature.c and might wind up forcing others to clean up our dirty
laundry in the future.

It also seems to me that if I wanted to raise the permitted DEBUGVER for KVM,
would I have to make a change outside of KVM.

I think the argument could be made for KVM having its own static +
verbose cpufeature tables. We've already been bitten by scenarios where
cpufeature exposes a feature that we simply do not virtualize in KVM.
That really can become a game of whack-a-mole. commit 96f4f6809bee
("KVM: arm64: Don't advertise FEAT_SPE to guests") is a good example,
and I can really see no end to these sorts of issues without an
overhaul. We'd need to also find a way to leverage the existing
infrasturcture for working out a system-wide safe value, but this time
with KVM's table of registers.

KVM would then need to take a change to expose any new feature that has
no involvement of EL2. Personally, I'd take that over the possibility of
another unhandled feature slipping through and blowing up a guest kernel
when running on newer hardware.

> (dynamically generate during KVM's initialization)

This was another one of my concerns with the current state of this
patch. I found the register table construction at runtime hard to
follow. I think it could be avoided with a helper that has a prescribed
set of rules (caller-provided field definition takes precedence over the
general one).

Sorry it took me a bit to comment on everything, needed to really sit
down and wrap my head around the series.
