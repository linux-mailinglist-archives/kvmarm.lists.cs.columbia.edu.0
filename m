I'm not following why we need to keep track of the 'pending unregister'
state directly. Is it not possible to infer from (active && !registered)?

Right, if an event retriggers when it is pending we still dispatch a
single event to the guest. And since we're only doing normal priority
events, it is entirely implementation defined which gets dispatched
first.

Does this need to be a bitmap though? We can't ever have more than one
SDEI event active at a time since this is private to a vCPU.

I think you can get away with putting active in there too, I don't see
why we need more than a single bit for this info.

I don't believe we can do that. The SDEI_EVENT_SIGNAL call should succeed,
even if the event was already pending.

Going to take a look at some of your later patches as well, just a heads
up.

Migration will be supported in a future spin of this series, not a
subsequent one right? :) I had just made the suggestion because there was
a lot of renovations that we were discussing.

Well, not entirely. Just need to make sure atomics are used to post
events to another vCPU in the case of SDEI_EVENT_SIGNAL.

set_bit() fits the bill here, as we've discussed.
