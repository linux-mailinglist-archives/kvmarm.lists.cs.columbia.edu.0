Thanks, Marc. I will replace the hunk of code with the following
comments, as you suggested, in next respin.

     /*
      * The request KVM_REQ_DIRTY_RING_SOFT_FULL will be cleared
      * by the VCPU thread next time when it enters the guest.
      */

I will post v8 after Peter/Sean/Oliver take a look on [PATCH v7 4/9].
I think we're settled on other patches.

Thanks,
Gavin
