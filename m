As you respin my series, with my prior agreement, I expected to find
most of the code I wrote, obviously with some potential fixes and
adaptations to fit your needs for additional tests.

However, in this v2, two significant v1 patches have disappeared:

1) [3/4] spe: Add profiling buffer test (170 LOC diffstat)
2) [4/4] spe: Test Profiling Buffer Events (150 LOC diffstat)

They were actually the crux of the original series (the introspection
test being required as a prerequisite but not testing much really ;-).

1) consists in a "spe-buffer" test starting the profiling on a mastered
sequence of instructions (as done for PMU event counters). It introduces
the infra to start the profiling, prepare SPE reset config, the macro
definitions, start/stop/drain, the code under profiling and basically
checks that the buffer was effectively written. We also check we do not
get any spurious event as it is not expected.

=> This test has disappeared and the infra now is diluted in
[kvm-unit-tests RFC PATCH v2 5/5] am64: spe: Add buffer test. However no
credit is given to my work as my S-o-b has disappeared.

2) consists in a "spe-events" test checking we effectively get the
buffer full event when duly expected. This introduces the infra to
handle interrupts, check the occurence of events by analyzing the
syndrome registers, compare occurences against expected ones. This
largely mimics what we have with PMU tests.

=> This test is part of [kvm-unit-tests RFC PATCH v2 5/5], relying on a
different stop condition, and again the infra is diluted in the same
patch, with large arbitrary changes, without any credit given to my
work. Those changes may explain why you removed my S-o-b but given the
anteriority of my series, this does not look normal to me, in a
community environment.

As discussed privately, this gives me the impression that those two
patches were totally ignored while respinning.

Please could you restructure the series at least to keep the buffer-full
test + infra separate from the new tests and reset a collaborative S-o-b.

Then if you think there are issues wrt the 1st test, "spe-buffer", not
included in this series, please let's discuss and fix/improve but not
simply trash it as is (in an everyone growing spirit).

An alternative is I can take back the ownership of my series and push it
upstream in a standard way. Then either you rebase your new tests on top
of it or I will be happy to do it for you after discussions on the
technical comments.

Thanks

Eric
