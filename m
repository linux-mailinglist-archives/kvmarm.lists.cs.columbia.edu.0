Yeah, I expressed it in wrong way. It should be - HVC is used by guest
to inject signal to host. Sorry for the confusion.

Sure, thanks for the pointer, which is very useful. Will already shared
the git repo link about the probing story. I'll take a look and come back
to you if I have more questions. Yes, arbitrary numbers in the range is
ok for prototyping.

The guest passively receives the async page fault from the host. It means
there is no hypercall issued by guest. I think the asynchronous property can
be stored in control block by host and it's retrieved by guest when the async
page fault is handled. In this way, I needn't a specific (IMPDEF) DFSC. Note
the physical address of the control block is passed to host when the functionality
is enabled by HVC.

Thanks,
Gavin
