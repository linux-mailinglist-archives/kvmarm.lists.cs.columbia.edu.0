I'm afraid your question is pretty ambiguous. What do you call a
KVM-enabled kernel? Do you mean as a KVM host? Or as a guest? The fact
that this is Android is pretty much irrelevant as far as KVM is
concerned.

Enabling a KVM guest requires nothing in particular. You only need the
required drivers that match what your VMM is offering as a
platform. Any distro kernel will probably run out of the box.

Enabling a KVM host is just a matter of selecting CONFIG_KVM in your
kernel configuration and installing the kernel.

There are however a bunch of requirements for that host kernel to be
able to serve as a hypervisor. The firmware has to boot the kernel in
the right context (EL2), and most of the Android-based devices are not
exactly cooperative on that front.

It would certainly help if you could more exactly detail what you are
after, as there are no pre-canned answers to your questions.

Thanks,

	M.
