As on the prior patch, I don't quite follow the rationale for the guest
fw coming from the host fw, and it seems to go against the usual design
for VM contents, so I fear it could be a problem in future (even if not
in android's specific model for usage).

What is that "pre-determined reset state"? e.g. is that just what KVM
does today, or is there something more specific (e.g. that might change
with the "Boot protocol version" below)?

What's the "Boot protocol" in this context? Is that just referring to
this handover state, or is that something more involved?

I assume this means that protected VMs always get a trusted PSCI
implementation? It might be worth mentioning so (and worth consdiering
if that should always have the SMCCC bits too).

Is this only going to run on CPUs without AArch32 EL0? ... or does this
mean behaviour will be erratic if someone tries to run AArch32 EL0?

Do you have anything in mind for those 7 fields, or was this just a
number that sounded big enough?

I wonder if it's worth adding an size field, and having a size argument
to the ioctl, so that you can discover the full size if we need to grow
this, but you can always get a truncated copy if you just need the early
fields.

Thanks,
Mark.
