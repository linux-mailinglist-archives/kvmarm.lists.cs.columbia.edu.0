I'll leave that up to you, since you're the one driving support for
kvmtool and, hopefully soon, bare-metal AArch64. BTW, I think we're long
overdue for adding kvmtool runner functionality, either by adapting what
we have (possibly by applying a TARGET variable :-) or by simply adding
new runner scripts. I personally would like to easily run kvmtool when
I'm testing arm/queue, and I don't want to have my own personal kvmtool
runner script to do that.

Deprecation requires you do two things at once; add a warning to the old
and add the new. I'm saying we don't need to deprecate --vmm. Either just
do the new (s/vmm/target/g) or always allow the old (s/vmm/target/g plus
make --vmm an alias for --target without any warning). I'd prefer the
first one, since I'm not too worried about a few users having to figure
out how to change their muscle memory and CI scripts when they start
getting unknown option errors at configure time.

Thanks,
drew
