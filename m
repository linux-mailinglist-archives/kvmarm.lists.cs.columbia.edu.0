Right, so I used this approach for consistency with the kernel's
PROT_NONE mappings:

	#define PTE_PROT_NONE	(_AT(pteval_t, 1) << 58) /* only when !PTE_VALID */

And in fact now that I think about it, it might be worth re-using the
same bit in stage 2.

But yes it would be pretty neat to use the other bits of invalid
mappings to add metadata about the pages. I could even drop the
PROT_NONE stuff straight away in favor of a more extensive mechanism for
tracking page ownership...

Thinking about it, it should be relatively straightforward to construct
the host stage 2 with the following invariants:

  1. everything is identity-mapped in the host stage 2;

  2. all valid mappings imply the underlying PA range belongs to the
     host;

  3. bits [63:32] (say) of all invalid mappings are used to store a
     unique identifier for the owner of the underlying PA range;

  4. the host identifier is 0, such that it owns all of memory by
     default at boot as its pgd is zeroed;

And then I could replace my PROT_NONE permission stuff by an ownership
change. E.g. the hypervisor would have its own identifier, and I could
use it to mark the .hyp memory sections as owned by the hyp (which
implies inaccessible by the host). And that should scale quite easily
when we start running protected guests as we'll assign them their own
identifiers. Sharing pages between guests (or even worse, between host
and guests) is a bit trickier, but maybe that is for later.

Thoughts?

The kernel has an explicit PAGE_NONE permission, so I followed the same
idea, but that could work as well. Now, as per the above discussion that
may not be relevant if we implement the page ownership thing.

Ack.
