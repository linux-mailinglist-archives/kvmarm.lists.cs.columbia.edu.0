That's a bit of mess-up. We obtain ID_AA64DFR0_EL1 from the sanitised
regs, but do most of our handling based on kvm->arch.pmuver. They really
should be the same, because that's what the sanitised registers give
you.

As for the events themselves, I don't get your drift. We do support
all the ARMv8.1 PMU events as long as the HW supports it, and we
don't lie to the guest about it either (cpuid_feature_cap_perfmon_field
does *cap* the field to some value, it doesn't allow it to increase
past what the HW supports).

We picked ARMv8.1 because this is the first PMU revision that gives
you events in the 0x4000 range, all of which are available on
common ARMv8.2 HW.


Thanks,
