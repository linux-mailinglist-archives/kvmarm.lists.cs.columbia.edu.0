Thanks for the explanation and details, which make things much clear. Since
the IMPDEF system register can't be used like this way, hypercall (HVC) would
be considered to serve same purpose - deliver signals from host to guest. However,
the hypercall number and behaviors are guarded by specification. For example,
the hypercalls used by para-virtualized stolen time, which are defined in
include/linux/arm-smccc.h, are specified by ARM DEN0057A [1]. So I need a
specification to be created, where the hypercalls used by this feature are
defined? If it's not needed, can I pick hypercalls that aren't used and define
their behaviors by myself?

[1] http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.den0057a/DEN0057A_Paravirtualized_Time_for_Arm_based_Systems_v1_0.pdf

Another thing I want to check is about the ESR_EL1[DFSC]. In this series,
the asynchronous page fault is identified by IMPDEF DFSC (Data Fault Status
Code) in ESR_EL1. According to what we discussed, the IMPDEF DFSC shouldn't
be fired (produced) by software. It should be produced by hardware either?
What I understood is IMPDEF is hardware behavior. If this is true, I need
to avoid using IMPDEF DFSC in next revision :)


Thanks,
Gavin
