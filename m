By definition (and implementation) offline. When you get a page = 
pfn_to_online_page() with page != NULL, that one should never be 
ZONE_DEVICE (otherwise it would be a BUG).

As I said, things are different when exposing dax memory via dax/kmem to 
the buddy. But then, we are no longer talking about ZONE_DEVICE.
