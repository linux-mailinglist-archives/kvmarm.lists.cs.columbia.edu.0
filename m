Yes, but, I would think we can have kvm_pmu_create_perf_event()
set vcpu->arch.pmu.arm_pmu based on the current physical CPU
when vcpu->arch.pmu.arm_pmu is null (then, the pmuver is handled
as if KVM_ARM_VCPU_PMU_V3_SET_PMU was done implicitly).

Yes, I understand.  As mentioned, this can work only when the
CPU affinity is set for vCPU threads appropriately (, which could
be done even without changing userspace).

Thanks,
Reiji
