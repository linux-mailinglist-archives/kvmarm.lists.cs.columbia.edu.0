Err... I hilariously hijacked its UAPI for the exit but added a new cap
for it :)

I think the direction going forward will be to provide userspace with a
range-based filter such that (to a degree) we can arbitrarily forward
hypercalls to userspace, allowing for a mix-and-match approach.

Yeah, this is certainly a lot cleaner than what I've proposed here. And
frankly, for my immediate interest (forwarding vendor hypercalls to
userspace), this would fit the bill. OTOH, I was hoping that something
a bit more flexible could move the onus of implementing every darn spec
onto userspace (where possible).

I know you said pKVM has no need for userspace notifications at this
moment, but could user hypercalls be useful again going forward?
