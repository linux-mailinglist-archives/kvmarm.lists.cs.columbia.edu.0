The feature is not mandatory and we do not require it for Linux.  It is
expected that many implementations will choose to not support FA64.

The only impact it has on the kernel is that if it's present then we
need to enable it for each EL and then context switch FFR in streaming
mode, the code is there to do that conditionally already.  We'd also
have to take it into account if we were to run streaming mode algorithms
in the kernel but if we ever do so that's just an additional feature
check when choosing to run such code.

There's a rather large subset of mostly FPSIMD and some SVE instructions
(including those for accessing FFR which is why we don't need to context
switch it in streaming mode), you can see a full list in appendix F1 of
the SME specification.

This is actually a bit awkward for not disabling streaming mode when we
do a syscall since the disabled instructions include the FPSMID mov
vector, vector instruction which we currently use to zero the high bits
of the Z registers.  That issue goes away if the optimisations I've got
for relaxed flushing of the non-shared SVE state that we discussed in
relation to syscall-abi get merged, though it'd still be there if we add
a sysctl to force flushing.  This is a solvable problem though, even if
we have to use a less efficient sequence to flush in streaming mode.

Given that it's optional and we need to check for it at runtime in order
to context switch it seems sensible to use the cpufeature infrastructure
for the detection.

That's there already since d198c77b7fab13d4 ("arm64: Document boot
requirements for FEAT_SME_FA64").
