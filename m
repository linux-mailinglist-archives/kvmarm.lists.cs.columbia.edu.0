Ah.  In the future, please provide this type of information in the cover letter,
and in this case, a paragraph in patch 01 is also warranted.  The context of _why_
is critical information, e.g. having something in the changelog explaining the use
case is very helpful for future developers wondering why on earth KVM supports
this type of odd behavior.

I'm not opposed to it.  My complaint is that this series is incomplete in that it
allows mapping the memory into the guest, but doesn't support accessing the memory
from KVM itself.  That means for things to work properly, KVM is relying on the
guest to use the memory in a limited capacity, e.g. isn't using the memory as
general purpose RAM.  That's not problematic for your use case, because presumably
the memory is used only by the vGPU, but as is KVM can't enforce that behavior in
any way.

The really gross part is that failures are not strictly punted to userspace;
the resulting error varies significantly depending on how the guest "illegally"
uses the memory.

My first choice would be to get the amdgpu driver "fixed", but that's likely an
unreasonable request since it sounds like the non-KVM behavior is working as intended.

One thought would be to require userspace to opt-in to mapping this type of memory
by introducing a new memslot flag that explicitly states that the memslot cannot
be accessed directly by KVM, i.e. can only be mapped into the guest.  That way,
KVM has an explicit ABI with respect to how it handles this type of memory, even
though the semantics of exactly what will happen if userspace/guest violates the
ABI are not well-defined.  And internally, KVM would also have a clear touchpoint
where it deliberately allows mapping such memslots, as opposed to the more implicit
behavior of bypassing ensure_pfn_ref().

If we're clever, we might even be able to share the flag with the "guest private
memory"[*] concept being pursued for confidential VMs.
