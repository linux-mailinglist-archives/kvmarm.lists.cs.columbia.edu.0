The asynchronous page fault is implemented upon a control path and a

This gives the impression the SDEI event is sent after the worker
completes the job. I think you should rephrase.

I think you should remind what is the intent of this KVM_REQ_ASYNC_PF
request, ie. notify that the page is ready.

I think you should briefly remind the motivation of SDEI and PPI
mechanism for both synchros. Maybe by doing an analogy with x86
implementation?

The "owned" terminology looks weird here. Do you mean the SDEI event
number and the PPI ID are defined by the VMM userspace?

How does the guest recognize which SDEI event num it shall register.
Same question for PPI? What if we were to expose the guest with several
SDEIs?

How does it compare to x86? I mean there are a huger number of IOCTLs
and SMCCC calls to achieve the functionaly. Was the x86 implementation
as invasive as this implementation?

Thanks
