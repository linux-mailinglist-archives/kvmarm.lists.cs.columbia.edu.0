I guess the optional CPU features are just going to keep on coming. And,
while more reviewers would help, there will never be enough. I think the
only solution is to get more CI.

It does get tested downstream, but certain configurations will likely
be neglected. For example, we've rarely, if ever, tested with the PMU
disabled. Also, testing downstream is a bit late. It'd be better if
tests were running on upstream branches, before even being merged to
master.

As for testing migration of devices other than the CPU, we do have
some QEMU unit tests for that which gate merger to QEMU master.

Anyway, while unit tests like this one may seem too simple to be useful,
assuming the tests mimic key parts of the fully integrated function, and
are run frequently, then they may catch regressions sooner, even during
development. The less frequently run integrated tests which happen later,
and with limited configs, may then be sufficient.

BTW, kvm-unit-tests can also test migrations. The VM configs are limited,
but CPU feature combinations could be tested thoroughly without too
much difficulty. That would at least include QEMU in the integration
testing, but unless we modify the tests to migrate between hosts with
different kernel versions (it's nice to try and support older -> newer),
then we're not testing the same type of thing that we're testing here with
this test.

Thanks,
drew
