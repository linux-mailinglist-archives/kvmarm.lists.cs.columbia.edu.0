Yeah, especially given the fact that LVA systems will be VHE capable
and may therefore not care in the first place.

On systems that have memory that high, EFI is likely to load the
kernel there, as it usually allocates from the top down, and it tries
to avoid having to move it around unless asked to (via KASLR), in
which case it will currently randomize over the entire available
memory space.

So it is going to add a special case for a corner^2 case, i.e., nVHE
on 52-bit/64k pages with more than 3968 TB distance between the start
and end of DRAM. Ugh.

It seems to me that the only way to solve this is to permit the idmap
and the hyp linear region to overlap, and use the 2^47 byte window at
the top of the address space for the hyp private mappings instead of
the one at the bottom.
