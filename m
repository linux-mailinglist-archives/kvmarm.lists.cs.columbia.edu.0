I'm beginning to wonder if the VMM/KVM split implementation of
system-scoped PSCI calls can ever be right. There exists a critical
section in all system-wide PSCI calls that currently spans an exit to
userspace. I cannot devise a sane way to guard such a critical section
when we are returning control to userspace.

For example, KVM offlines all of the CPUs except for the exiting CPU
when handling SYSTEM_RESET or SYSTEM_OFF, but nothing prevents an
interleaving KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT or KVM_SET_MP_STATE from disturbing the
state of the VM. Couldn't even say its a userspace bug, either, because
a different vCPU could do something before the caller has exited. Even
if we grab all the vCPU mutexes, we'd need to drop them before exiting
to userspace.

If userspace decides to reject the PSCI call, we're giving control
back to the guest in a wildly different state than it had making the
PSCI call. Again, the PSCI spec is vague on this matter, but I believe
the intuitive answer is that we should not change the VM state if the call
is rejected. This could upset an otherwise well-behaved KVM guest.

Doing SYSTEM_SUSPEND in userspace is better, as KVM avoids mucking with
the VM state before the PSCI call is actually accepted. However, any of
the consistency checks in the kernel for SYSTEM_SUSPEND are entirely
moot. Anything can happen between the exit to userspace and the moment
userspace actually recognizes the SYSTEM_SUSPEND call on the exiting
CPU.

KVM rejecting attempts to resume vCPUs besides the caller will break
a correct userspace, given the inherent race that crops up when exiting.
Blocking attempts to resume other vCPUs could have unintented
consequences as well. It seems that we'd need to prevent
KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT calls as well as KVM_SET_MP_STATE, even though the
former could be used in a valid SYSTEM_SUSPEND implementation.

I really do hate to go back to the drawing board on the PSCI stuff
again, but there seems to be a fundamental issue in how system-scoped
calls are handled. Userspace is probably the only place where we could
quiesce the VM state, assess if the PSCI call should be accepted, and
change the VM state.

Do you think all of this is an issue as well?
