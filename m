Yes, bit 31 of the event number should be zero. So this is invalid
event number, used by struct kvm_sdei_vcpu_state::critical_num
and normal_num to indicate if there is event being handled on the
corresponding vcpu. When those fields are set to KVM_SDEI_INVALID_EVENT,
no event is being handled on the vcpu.

For KVM_SDEI_DEFAULT_EVENT, which corresponds to the software signaled
event. As you suggested on PATCH[15/22], we can't assume its usage.
I will define it with SDEI_SW_SIGNALED_EVENT in uapi/linux/arm_sdei.h

For KVM_SDEI_MAX_EVENTS, it will be moved from this header file to
kvm_sdei.h after static arrays to hold the data structures or their
pointers are used, as you suggested early for this patch (PATCH[02/22]).

There are two types of (SDEI) events: shared and private. For the private
event, it can be registered independently from the vcpus. It also means
the address and argument for the entry points, corresponding to @ep_address
and @ep_arg in struct kvm_sdei_registered_event, can be different on
the individual vcpus. However, all the registered/enabled states and
the entry point address and argument are same on all vcpus for the shared
event. KVM_SDEI_MAX_VCPUS was introduced to use same data structure to
represent both shared and private event.

If the data belongs to particular vcpu should be accessed through the
vcpu fd, then we need to split or reorganize the data struct as below.

     /*
      * The events are exposed through ioctl interface or similar
      * mechanism (synthetic system registers?) before they can be
      * registered. struct kvm_sdei_exposed_event instance is reserved
      * from the kvm's static array on receiving the ioctl command
      * from VMM.
      */
     struct kvm_sdei_exposed_event {
         __u32   num;

         __u8    type;
         __u8    signaled;
         __u8    priority;
         __u8    padding;
     };

     /*
      * The struct kvm_sdei_registered_event instance is allocated or
      * reserved from the static array. For the shared event, the instance
      * is linked to kvm, but it will be allocated or reserved from vcpu's
      * static array and linked to the vcpu if it's a private event.
      *
      * The instance is only allocated and reserved upon SDEI_EVENT_REGISTER
      * hypercall.
      */
     struct kvm_sdei_registered_event {
         __u32   num

#define KVM_SDEI_EVENT_STATE_REGISTERED         (1 << 0)

Yeah, it is a kernel function pointer, used by Async PF to know if
the corresponding event has been handled or not. Async PF can cancel
the previously injected event for performance concerns. Either Async PF
or SDEI needs to migrate it. To keep SDEI transparent enough to Async PF,
SDEI is responsible for its migration.

@route_mode and @route_affinity can't be configured or modified until
the event is registered. Besides, they're only valid to the shared
events. For private events, they don't have the routing needs. It means
those two fields would be part of struct kvm_sdei_registered_event instead
of kvm_sdei_exposed_event.

They're accessed through vcpu or kvm fd depending on what type the event
is. For the VM-owned shared event, they're accessed through KVM fd. For the
vcpu-owned private event, they're accessed through vcpu fd.

I'm not sure if I catch the idea to have a synthetic register and I'm to
confirm. If I'm correct, you're talking about the "IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED"
system register, whose OP0 and CRn are 0B11 and 0B1x11. If two implementation
defined registers can be adopted, I don't think we need to expose anything
through ABI. All the operations and the needed data can be passed through
the system registers.

     SYS_REG_SDEI_COMMAND
         Receives commands like to expose event, register event and change
         vcpu state etc.
     SYS_REG_SDEI_DATA
         The needed data corresponding to the received command.

However, I'm not positive that synthetic register can be used here. When
Mark Rutland review "PATCH[RFC v1] Async PF support", the implementation
defined registers can't be used in a very limited way. That time, a set
of implementation defined registers are defined to identify the asynchronous
page faults and access to the control data block. However, the idea was
rejected. Later on, Marc recommended SDEI for Async PF.

Yeah, it's much convenient to use the implementation defined register here.
However, I'm not positive if we can do this. Please see the details I
provided above :)
