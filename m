I've just noticed that I mistakenly dropped all the CC-list
when I replied to Andrew's first email.
So, I've added all of them back.  I'm sorry for the mistake.

The following email still includes all the discussion with Andrew
except for the first comment about using @<param> for the source
code comments of arm64_check_features(), which I will fix in v2.

No, it wasn't noise.  It was good for me to confirm that.
Thank you so much for the comment.
