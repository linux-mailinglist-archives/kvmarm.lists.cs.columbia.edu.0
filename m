To clarify for others, Ricardo thought that x86 selftests were already using a
read-only memslot for ucalls, hence the confusion.

+1.  x86 currently uses I/O with a hardcoded port, but theoretically that's just
as error prone as hardcoding a GPA, it just works because x86 doesn't have any
port I/O tests.

Ugh, and that made me look at sync_regs_test.c, which does its own open coded
ucall.  That thing is probably working by dumb luck at this point.
