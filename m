FWIW we used a similar approach in early versions of the TDP MMU, but
instead of page->private used page->lru so that more metadata could be
stored in page->private.
Ultimately that ended up being too limiting and we decided to switch
to just using the associated struct kvm_mmu_page as the list element.
I don't know if ARM has an equivalent construct though.
