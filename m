I wasn't suggesting we be prescriptive, it was an honest question.

But we're adding a new API regardless.  A per-VM ring would definitely be a bigger
addition, but if using the dirty_bitmap won't actually meet the needs of userspace,
then we'll have added a new API and still not have solved the problem.  That's why
I was asking why/when userspace would want to use dirty_ring+dirty_bitmap.

Kicking all vCPUs with the soft-full request isn't _that_ awkward.  It's certainly
sub-optimal, but if inserting into the per-VM ring is relatively rare, then in
practice it's unlikely to impact guest performance.

How large is the ITS?  If it's a fixed, small size, could we treat the ITS as a
one-off case for now?  E.g. do something gross like shove entries into vcpu0's
dirty ring?

Ah, so enabling the dirty bitmap isn't strictly required.  That means this patch
is wrong, and it also means that we need to figure out how we want to handle the
case where mark_page_dirty_in_slot() is invoked without a running vCPU on a memslot
without a dirty_bitmap.

I.e. what's an appropriate action in the below sequence:

void mark_page_dirty_in_slot(struct kvm *kvm,
			     const struct kvm_memory_slot *memslot,
		 	     gfn_t gfn)
{
	struct kvm_vcpu *vcpu = kvm_get_running_vcpu();

#ifdef CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_DIRTY_RING
	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(vcpu && vcpu->kvm != kvm))
		return;

#ifndef CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_DIRTY_RING_WITH_BITMAP
	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(!vcpu))
		return;
#endif
#endif

	if (memslot && kvm_slot_dirty_track_enabled(memslot)) {
		unsigned long rel_gfn = gfn - memslot->base_gfn;
		u32 slot = (memslot->as_id << 16) | memslot->id;

		if (vcpu && kvm->dirty_ring_size)
			kvm_dirty_ring_push(&vcpu->dirty_ring,
					    slot, rel_gfn);
		else if (memslot->dirty_bitmap)
			set_bit_le(rel_gfn, memslot->dirty_bitmap);
		else
			???? <=================================================
	}
}


Would it be possible to require a dirty bitmap when an ITS is created?  That would
allow treating the above condition as a KVM bug.

For posterity, filling in my missing idea...

Since the size is restricted to be well below a 32-bit value, and it's unlikely
that KVM will ever support 4GiB per-vCPU rings, we could usurp the upper bits for
flags:

  static int kvm_vm_ioctl_enable_dirty_log_ring(struct kvm *kvm, u64 arg0)
  {
	u32 flags = arg0 >> 32;
	u32 size = arg0;

However, since it sounds like enabling dirty_bitmap isn't strictly required, I
have no objection to enabling KVM_CAP_DIRTY_LOG_RING_WITH_BITMAP, my objection
was purely that KVM was adding a per-VM flag just to sanity check the configuration.

I agree that uniformity would be nice, but for capabilities I don't think that's
ever going to happen.  I'm pretty sure supporting enabling is actually in the
minority.  E.g. of the 20 capabilities handled in kvm_vm_ioctl_check_extension_generic(),
I believe only 3 support enabling (KVM_CAP_HALT_POLL, KVM_CAP_DIRTY_LOG_RING, and
KVM_CAP_MANUAL_DIRTY_LOG_PROTECT2).
