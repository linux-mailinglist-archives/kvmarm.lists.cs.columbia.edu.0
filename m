I just have my gripes with those enable/disable pair, which are two related, but actually separate options, both polluting the command line options space and also being confusing to the user.
> I would be much happier if we would have one option per feature and a parameter: "--ptrauth={enable,disable}". Omitting the option altogether defaults to "enabled-if-available". Specifying it will force it on or off, accompanied by an error message if either(?) if not possible. This would also remove the need for the somewhat awkward "don't enable both" check.

Happy to do something like that, though it looks like the decision to
drop the options altogether may preempt that...
