ARMv8.3 added support for nested virtualization, which makes it possible
for a hypervisor to run another hypervisor as a guest. Support for nested
virtualization is being worked on in KVM [1].

This patch series aims to make it possible for kvm-unit-tests to run at EL2
under KVM. The focus has been on having all the infrastructure in place to
run at EL2, and not on adding comprehensive tests for this Exception Level.
All existing tests that fulfill KVM's requirements for a nested guest (the
architecture is arm64 and they use GICv3) will be able to be run at EL2.

To keep the changes minimal, kvm-unit-tests will run with VHE enabled when
it detects that has been booted at EL2. Functions for enabling and
disabling VHE have been added, with the aim to let the user specify to
disable VHE for a given test via command-line parameters. At the moment,
only the timer test has been modified to run with VHE disabled.

The series are firmly an RFC because:
* The patches that implement KVM nested support are themselves in the RFC
  phase.
* Some tests don't complete because of bugs in the current version of the
  KVM patches. Where appropriate, I will provide fixes to allow the tests
  to finish, however those fixes are my own have not been reviewed in any
  way. Use at your own risk.

To run the tests, one obviously needs KVM with nested virtualization
support from [2]. These patches have been tested from commit
78c66132035c ("arm64: KVM: nv: Allow userspace to request
KVM_ARM_VCPU_NESTED_VIRT"), on top of which the following patches have been
cherry-picked from upstream Linux:
* b4a1583abc83 ("KVM: arm/arm64: Fix emulated ptimer irq injection")
* 16e604a437c8 ("KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Reevaluate level sensitive
  interrupts on enable")

Without those two patches some timer tests will fail.

A version of kvmtool that knows about nested virtualization is also
needed [3]. The kvmtool --nested parameter is required for releasing a
guest at EL2. For example, to run the newly added selftest-el2 test:

lkvm -f selftest.flat -c 2 -m 128 -p el2 --nested --console serial \
	--irqchip gicv3

Changes in v2:
* Gathered Reviewed-by tags.
* Implemented review comments (more details in the specific patches).
* Patch #1 was remove and I've added 4 new patches: #1 removes the obsolete
  CPU_OFF parameter; #4 implements a TODO from arm's flush_tlb_all; #10
  fixes asm_mmu_enable; #11 replaces an expensive and unnecessary TLBI with
  the correct one.

Summary of the patches:
* Patches 1-13 are various fixes or enhancements and can be merged without
  the rest of the series.
* Patches 14-16 add support for running at EL2. A basic selftest-el2 test
  is added that targets EL2.
* Patches 17-19 add support for disabling VHE. The timer and selftest-el2
  tests are modified to use this feature.
