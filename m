Uh oh, more terms with differences that I don't understand yet.

I assume that there aren't SError Interrupts that we would be concerned
about being deliered to the guest that should have been delivered to the
host after checing for asynchronous external aborts? At least, that seem
to be the current behaviour if I'm reading things right.

I'm not sure it would be easy to check ISR_EL1 and bail to the host in
the general case as it would require a meaningful return code for each
context, something like EAGAIN that doesn't exist in the hyp interfaces.

I was instead thinking that EL2 would continue as usual except it won't
consume any SErrors with the ESB. Care is needed when a vCPU is being
run and the DSB-ISB + ISR_EL1 check in __guest_enter is be there to
prevent a guest being entered if the host needs to handle an SError.

Not yet, but it might happen e.g. to context switch FPSIMD under
protected KVM.

Does a save and restore of DISR_EL1 (see other thread on this series)
address the concerns here or would you still think it better to start
virtualizing for the host?
