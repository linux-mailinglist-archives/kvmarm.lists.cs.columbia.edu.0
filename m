Hi Haibo,

Sounds like you are making good progress - thanks for the update. Have 
you thought about how the PROT_MTE mappings might work if QEMU itself 
were to use MTE? My worry is that we end up with MTE in a guest 
preventing QEMU from using MTE itself (because of the PROT_MTE 
mappings). I'm hoping QEMU can wrap its use of guest memory in a 
sequence which disables tag checking (something similar will be needed 
for the "protected VM" use case anyway), but this isn't something I've 
looked into.

Great, I look forward to hearing how it goes.

Thanks,

Steve
