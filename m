Yes, the number of events in KVM is small. Including the events for Async
PF and the software signaled event, 8 events would be enough currently. In
the meanwhile, there are several types of objects for various events. Some
of them can be put into static array, while the left might need static array
of pointers to avoid the linked list:

    struct kvm_sdei_exposed_event/state         on struct kvm_arch
           size: 24 bytes
           static array, 8 entries
    struct kvm_sdei_registered_event/state      on struct kvm_arch
           size: 9KB
           static array of pointers, still need allocate them dynamically, 8 entries
    struct kvm_sdei_vcpu_event/state            on struct kvm_vcpu_arch
           size: 16 bytes
           static array, 8 entries

Sure, I will do in next respin.

Yep, "struct kvm_vcpu_sdei" is the one I will have in next respin :)

Yes, I agree. I can have a separate patch as preparatory work to
route the range of hypercalls to their owner for further handling.
In this way, we can route the range of SDEI hypercalls to its own
handler. I will figure it out in next respin.
