For those CPU_SUSPEND calls which lose context, is there no EL2 state
that you need to save/restore, or is that all saved elsewhere already?

The usual suspects are PMU, debug, and timers, so maybe not. It'd be
nice to have a statement in the commit message if we're certain there's
no state that we need to save.

I found this a bit confusing since the first sentence can be read to
mean that CPU_ON is expected to compose with CPU_SUSPEND, whereas what
this is actually saying is the implementation ensures they don't
interact. How about:

| CPU_ON and CPU_SUSPEND are both implemented using struct cpu_boot_args
| to store the state upon powerup, with each CPU having separate structs
| for CPU_ON and CPU_SUSPEND so that CPU_SUSPEND can operate locklessly
| and so that a CPU_ON xall targetting a CPU cannot interfere with a
| concurrent CPU_SUSPEND call on that CPU.

The patch itself looks fine to me.

Thanks,
Mark.
