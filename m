Are you asking about this PI field in particular, or for any field in general?

In this particular case, visibility and documentation is really the only difference,
functionally the result is the same.  But that's also very much related to why this
case gets the exception listed above.  The "use it normally" part is also why I
don't want to tag the field volatile since writing the field absolutely cannot be
done "normally", it must be done atomically, and volatile doesn't capture that
detail.

If you're asking about fields in general, the "volatile is harmful" guideline is
to deter usage of volatile for cases where the field/variable in question is not
intrinsically volatile.  As the docs call out, using volatile in those cases often
leads to worse code generation because the compiler is disallowed from optimizing
accesses that are protected through other mechanisms.

A good example in x86 KVM is the READ_ONCE(sp->unsync) in mmu_try_to_unsync_pages() to
force the compiler to emit a load of sp->unsync after acquiring mmu_unsync_pages_lock.
Tagging "unsync" as volatile is unnecessary since the vast majority of its usage is
protected by holding a spinlock for write, and would prevent optimizing references in
kvm_mmu_get_page() and other flows that are protected by mmu_lock in the legacy MMU.
