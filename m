Architecturally it seems dodgy to export any address that isn't "normal 
memory" (i.e. with tag storage) to the guest as Normal Cacheable. 
Although I'm a bit worried this might cause a regression in some 
existing case.

That would be an easy way of doing the filtering, but it's not clear 
whether PROT_MTE is actually what the VMM wants (it most likely doesn't 
want to have tag checking enabled on the memory in user space).

Yes pfn_valid() should have been in there. At the moment pfn_to_page() 
is called without any checks.

The problem with attempting to reject a memory slot is that the memory 
backing that slot can change. So checking at the time the slot is 
created isn't enough (although it might be a useful error checking feature).

It's not clear to me what we can do at fault time when we discover the 
memory isn't tag-capable and would have been mapped cacheable other than 
kill the VM.

As above, we will struggle to catch all cases during slot creation, so I 
think we're going to have to deal with this late detection as well.

Patch 2 introduces a VCPU feature which must be explicitly enabled for 
the guest to have MTE. So it won't break existing VMMs. However clearly 
simply setting that bit will likely break some configurations where not 
all memory is MTE capable.

The VMM needs to be fully aware of MTE before it's enabled by KVM 
otherwise it could lose the tags (e.g. during migration). So my 
preference is to make it an explicit opt-in.

Indeed it would be useful to have input from those familiar with VMMs as 
to what a good interface looks like.

Thanks,
