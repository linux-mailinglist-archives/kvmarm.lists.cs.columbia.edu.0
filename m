This series intends to fix two bugs in the timer test. The first one is the
TVAL comparison to check that the timer has expired and was found by code
inspection.

The second one I found while playing with KVM, but it can manifest itself
on certain hardware configuration with an unmodified version of KVM
(details in the commit message for the last patch). Or on baremetal (not
tested). In short, WFI can complete for a variety of reason, not just
because an interrupt targetted at the VM was asserted. The fix I
implemented was to do WFI in a loop until we get the interrupt or TVAL
shows that the timer has expired.

All the patches in between are an attempt make the tests more robust and
slightly easier to understand. If these changes are considered unnecessary,
I would be more than happy to drop them; the main goal of the series is to
fix the two bugs.

Tested on a rockpro64 with KVM modifed to clear HCR_EL2.TWI, which means
that the WFI instruction is not trapped (WFI trapping is a performance
optimization, not a correctness requirement):
