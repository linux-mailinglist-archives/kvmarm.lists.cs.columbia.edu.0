Given that DSB is about completion rather than ordering, completion only
matters for endpoints and the endpoint in this scenarion is part of the
same observer, DSB NSH should be sufficient. Ordering of accesses as
observed by other CPUs should be handled with DMB or acquire/release.

So if the aux buffer code is missing barriers, we should add them there,
like you proposed before:

What happened to that?
