Just wanted to explicitly highlight this point... can folks please
continue to Cc the old list until we migrate to the new one?
lore.kernel.org archives *only* contain mail sent to the columbia.edu
address right now.

Fortunately, the series I'm aware of that didn't do this still hit
another archived list so I could find it with a bit more digging.

Marc -- any idea when we're going to finally switch to the new world?

Oliver
