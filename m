Just to be clear, what I meant "this could be added later" is that
the feature consistency checking between 64bit ID registers and 32bit ID
registers could be added later.  It means configuring ID registers
itself will be allowed for EL1 aarch64 guests including ones that
support EL0 aarch32 (but not for EL1 aarch32 guests).

Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
They look almost the same as what I've been thinking.

Thanks,
Reiji
