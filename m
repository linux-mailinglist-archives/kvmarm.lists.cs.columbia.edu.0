Gotcha, so porting the TDP MMU to ARM would require adding
break-before-make support. That seems feasible and we could guard it
behind a e.g. static_key so there is no runtime overhead for
architectures (or ARM hardware revisions) that do not require it.
Anything else come to mind as major architectural differences?

Ah, interesting. It'd probably make sense to start with the VM
2-dimensional paging use-case and leave the other use-cases using the
existing MMU, and then investigate transitioning the other use-cases.
Similarly in x86 we still have the legacy MMU for shadow paging (e.g.
hosts with no stage-2 hardware, and nested virtualization).
