I explained that badly. A system supporting MTE doesn't have to have all
CPUs running AArch64 - fairly obviously you can boot a 32 bit OS on a
system supporting AArch64.

Since the KVM capability is a VM capability it's not architecturally
inconsistent to enable it even if all your CPUs are running AArch32 (at
EL1 and lower) - just a bit pointless.

However, given your comment that a mixture of AArch32/AArch64 VCPUs is a
bug - we can fail creation of AArch32 VCPUs and I'll explicitly document
this is a AArch64 only feature.

Thanks,

Steve
