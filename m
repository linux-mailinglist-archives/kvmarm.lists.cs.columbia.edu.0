The message is correct, my bad.

Then how about explicitly checking for the KVM_ARM64_PENDING_EXCEPTION and
KVM_ARM64_INCREMENT_PC flags, like it's done in __kvm_adjust_pc? That would
certainly make the code easier to understand, as it's not immediately obvious that
the EXCEPT mask includes the INCREMENT_PC flag.
