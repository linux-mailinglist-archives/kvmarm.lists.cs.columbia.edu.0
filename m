Ah, right, good luck doing that without some help from the kernel. +1
to this _not_ being a KVM issue, but anyways...

Yeah, these additions all make sense to me.

I think I follow what you're saying. To confirm:

My suggested ioctl for the vCPU will still exist, and it will still
affect the VMCS tsc offset, right? However, we need to do one of the
following:

- Stash the guest's MSR_IA32_TSC_ADJUST value in the
kvm_system_counter_state structure. During
KVM_SET_SYSTEM_COUNTER_STATE, check to see if the field is valid. If
so, treat it as a dumb value (i.e. show it to the guest but don't fold
it into the offset).
- Inform userspace that it must still migrate MSR_IA32_TSC_ADJUST, and
continue to our quirky behavior around host-initiated writes of the
MSR.

This is why Maxim's spin migrated a value for IA32_TSC_ADJUST, right?
Doing so ensures we don't have any guest-observable consequences due
to our migration of TSC state. To me, adding the guest IA32_TSC_ADJUST
MSR into the new counter state structure is probably best. No strong
opinions in either direction on this point, though :)
