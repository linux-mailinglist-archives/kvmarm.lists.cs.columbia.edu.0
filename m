Do you have some rough numbers to quantify the gain? I suspect the
vector length doesn't matter much.

Where does the zeroing happen now? IIRC it's only done on a subsequent
trap to SVE and that's a lot more expensive (unless the code has changed
since last time I looked).

So if it's the actual subsequent trap that adds the overhead, maybe
zeroing the regs while leaving TIF_SVE on won't be that bad.

IIRC both Will and Mark R commented in the past that they'd like the
current de-facto ABI to become the official one. I'll let them comment.

If we leave TIF_SVE on, does it mean that we incur an overhead on
context switching? E.g. something like hackbench with lots of syscalls
communicating between threads would unnecessarily context switch the SVE
state. Maybe there's something handling this but IIUC fpsimd_save()
seems to only check TIF_SVE.
