Jose -- having an SMC interface to see if the firmware is holding up its
side of the bargian would be really helpful here. There's been one in
development for _months_ now; any update?

Honestly, I think a TAINT is pointless here and we shouldn't be in the
business of trying to police what people do with their systems when there's
absolutely nothing we can do to help them. After all, they can always
disable KVM themselves if they want to. The only sensible action you can
take on seeing the taint is to disable the workaround to get rid of it,
which is also the worst thing you can do! As another example, imagine if
we had the ability to detect whether or not firmware was setting the patch
registers. If we knew that it wasn't applying the workaround, would we
TAINT on entering userspace? I don't think so. We'd probably just print a
message when trying to apply the workaround, indicating that it was
incomplete and the system may deadlock.

Finally, we have another erratum that allows guests to deadlock the system
(Cortex-A57 832075) so ultimately it's up to the person deploying the system
to decide whether or not they can tolerate the risk of deadlock. In many
cases, it won't be an issue, but if it is and they require KVM, then the
part is dead in the water and Linux can't help with that.
