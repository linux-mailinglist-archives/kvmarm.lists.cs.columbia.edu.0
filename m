Yes, although I wonder whether we should integrate this deeply into
the dirty-log mechanism: it would be really interesting to dump the
tags at the point where the page is flagged as clean from a dirty-log
point of view. As the page is dirtied, discard the saved tags.

It is probably expensive, but it ensures that the VMM sees consistent
tags (if the page is clean, the tags are valid). Of course, it comes
with the added requirement that the VMM allocates enough memory to
store the tags, which may be a tall order. I'm not sure how to
give a consistent view to userspace otherwise.

It'd be worth looking at how much we can reuse from the ptrace (and
I expect swap?) code to implement this.

Thanks,

         M.
