Note that these MMU notifiers only make sense when something happens on
the host: attribute change (for page aging, for example) or unmap
(e.g. page being swapped out).

Yes, and not necessarily a useful one. I think I have a patch to drop
that.

Indeed, just with a different set of page tables.

user_mem_abort() is your friend (or not, it's a very nasty piece of
code). If you trace the fault handling path all the way from the EL2
vectors, you will eventually get there.

Well, *something* must be handling the fault, right? But if you've
wrapped the host with its own S2 page tables, it may not be able to
populate the S2 pages for the guest (wild guess...).

Hope this helps,
