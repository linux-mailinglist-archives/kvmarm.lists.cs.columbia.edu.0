My bad. At that time I was able to test with 224 vcpus with QEMU (256
vcpus were tested as well) and I failed to see those other limitations,
thinking the only limitation left was the number of redistributor
regions we could register.

The initial goal was to keep up with the HPC physical cpu count increase
and allow similar numbers as x86 supports.
