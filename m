Hello all,

Based on the recent discussion on the patch '[RFC PATCH v3 01/11] KVM:
Capture VM start' [1], Reiji, I (and others in the team) were
wondering, since the hypercall feature-map is technically per-VM and
not per-vCPU, would it make more sense to present it as a kvm_device,
rather than vCPU psuedo-registers to the userspace?

If I understand correctly, the original motivation for going with
pseudo-registers was to comply with QEMU, which uses KVM_GET_REG_LIST
and KVM_[GET|SET]_ONE_REG interface, but I'm guessing the VMMs doing
save/restore across migration might write the same values for every
vCPU.

Granted that we would be diverging from the existing implementation
(psci versioning and spectre WA registers), but this can be a cleaner
way forward for extending hypercall support. The kvm_device interface
can be made backward compatible with the way hypercalls are exposed
today, it can have the same registers/features discovery mechanisms
that we discussed above, and majorly the userspace has to configure it
only once per-VM. We can probably make the feature selection immutable
just before any vCPU is created.

Please let me know your thoughts or any disadvantages that I'm overlooking.

Thanks,
Raghavendra
