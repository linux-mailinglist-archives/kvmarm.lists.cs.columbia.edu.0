Hi  Andrew,

Interesting question! It's more about ease and flexibility in
controlling the guest via the VMM-
Since arch_timer's interface is mostly per-CPU, we'd like to extend
this test case to be
more stressful, such as migrating the vCPUs across pCPUs rapidly, or
even affining
a large number of vCPUs to a single pCPU, and so on.

On the other hand, since the patch series brings-in a lot of aarch64
goodies with it,
such as interrupt support, it might encourage others to add more arch
specific tests
easily :) For example, we also plan to add tests that verifies KVM
interface for interrupts,
for which the GIC support in the series would come handy.

I'm still gaining understanding of kvm-unit-tests. However, I'm
curious to know your thoughts as
well in-support of kvm-unit-tests.

Unfortunately, I don't have any immediate plans to submit patches on
arch_timer for
kvm-unit-tests.

Thanks,
Raghavendra
