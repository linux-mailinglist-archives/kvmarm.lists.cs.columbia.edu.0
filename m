In general, the commit log must be accurate, so you are free to change
it at any time to reflect what the patch does.

One patch-set, at least two patches (and a cover letter).

32bit-on-64bit is what I care about, yes. 32bit *host* is on its way to
retirement, as you found out. And yes, just booting any 32bit guest and
checking that you indeed trap access to an IMPDEF register would be 
enough.

I think there is more than just A76. A55 definitely has TGran16, as well 
as
A73, A75, A65 (I've stopped looking in the various TRMs). So definitely
in the realm of SBCs (I have a quad A55 on my desk, worth $70).

I'm pretty sure this wouldn't work with HW virtualization. I suspect
this would UNDEF directly on the CPU, leading to an exception being 
taken
at EL1 without intervention of the hypervisor. Which makes sense as 
you'd
be executing an instruction that the CPU really doesn't implement.

Fun! ;-)

I'm looking forward to your posting of the next version that would 
include
32bit supoport. Another thing I'd ask is a corresponding support patch 
for
a userspace VMM of your choice (QEMU, kvmtool) so that I can at least 
exercise
the support.

Thanks,

         M.
