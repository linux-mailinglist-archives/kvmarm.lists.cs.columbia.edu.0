Hi Gavin,

[my mail client went a bit nuts - it thinks this got sent already, sorry if you received
it twice!]

I only got so far through this, so may have focussed on the wrong things.
This patch has too many things going on. Please split it up.

I think the page-fault and page-present should be done separately, with the gubbins the
core-code needs added first. The cap and corresponding documentation should be added last
so the whole thing bisects.

It looks like the guest and hypervisor parts are already split up, this is helpful,
thanks. Please ensure that the descriptions are clear on this distinction too. Its not at
all clear where where the 'reschedule ipi' comes from in this commit message.

I'd really like it if as much of the guest parts as possible lived in common code. There
is nothing arch-specific about an interrupt and reading from shared memory.

Yes, its the cost of abstracting the machine's resources and invisibly carving them up.

Why is it an issue? You've missed the important part of the commit message: why we should
make this change.

This needs to mention postcopy live migration, which is the reason for doing any of this.

I don't think "I overcommited and swapped the guest to disk" is at all compelling.
(as the doctor says: don't do that then)

Be suspended by the hypervisor until the resources are available.
Normally the guest has no idea this is happening.

... so you don't need the ACPI table?

The 'asynchrononous page fault' notification obviously needs to be (er,) synchronous, so
it has to be per-cpu.

Why is the page-ready IRQ a PPI? We have a limited number of these, so shouldn't use one
unless it _needs_ to be per-cpu.

'vcpu index' should probably be the MPIDR_EL1, which is something both the host and guest
already know that identifies the vcpu. Inventing something new isn't necessary.

what does 'requested page background' mean? (missing the words 'in the'?)

A PPI is made pending, when the PPI is pending?

I hope the 'token' is nothing more than the IPA.

#ifdef-ing a struct makes it harder to use IS_ENABLED() in the C code, which in turn makes
it harder to get complete coverage from the CI builders without aligning the stars to hit
the right randconfig combination.

Please avoid doing this unless its absolutely necessary. (its not like a struct definition
takes up any space in the binary)

See above. Any reason these can't be dynamically allocated if the feature is enabled by
the VMM? (You're using a PPI, this has to be allocated by the VMM).

Not all guests would use this, so its a waste of space if its enabled but not in use.

a per-vcpu id? KVM already has one, and the architecture has one that the guest can see too.

This is part of kvmclock? aarch64 has an architecture specific way of doing that stuff.
Why is this here?!

(if you've turned something on that needs these stubs, its probably worth doing that in an
preparation patch so you can explain why, instead of hiding it in here)

The arch specific version is practically the same as the asm-generic one.

Please explain why you need to do this in a preparatory patch.

Presumably this is the reason to carry around an extra copy of kvm_para.h.

Wouldn't it be better to unpick that dependency instead?

kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu() allocates vcpu with kmem_cache_zalloc(), so this field will
already be zero.

As you are adding a conditional __copy_from_user() in here, please add an unconditional
might_sleep() at the top of this function. This lets us catch locations that will
sometimes break the first time they happen.

Please use IS_ENABLED() here, #ifdeffery make this stuff harder to read and harder to

(if you can come up with a readable IS_ENABLED() way of returning the _check_extension()
result - even better!)

You added a helper for this: kvm_async_pf_read_cache()...

This really ought to wrapped up in a helper that gives a hint as to what it is doing.

There are two magic locations in guest memory that means the guest controls whether it is
runnable or not... this sounds like a source of hard-to-debug issues.

I'd much prefer it if the guest only ever got blocked in the stage2 fault handler, as it
does today. This mechanism just provides information about what is going on at stage2,
which allows the guest to avoid getting blocked if it can do something about it.

Giving the guest access to the controls doesn't look right.

(IS_ENABLED() would save you the link error ... providing a stub in core-code for
kvm_check_async_pf_completion() would let you rely on this request never being made instead)

A double READ_ONCE() looks wrong. If you have to do this, presumably you didn't want a
vcpu->request to begin with.

It looks like KVM_REQ_APF_READY only exists to move the page-ready work onto the vcpu
thread because the vcpu got blocked further out by kvm_arch_vcpu_runnable(), and the
second half of the stage2-fault now needs doing.


I think it would be simpler to only ever block in the stage2 fault handler. The guest can
only ever be blocked on one stage2 fault at a time, so this abstraction to let it sleep
for any number is pointless. If I'm waiting for ipa-4, and get restarted because ipa-6 is
now available ... I'm going to fault on ipa-4 for a second time. There is no point
restarting the guest until it can make progress again.


From the first stage2 fault you can kick off the page-fault notification (which must be
synchronous, so can be notified without taking this fault again). If the vcpu takes a
fault that was already notified, it clearly can't handle the page-fault notification and
must be blocked until that page is available.

We should be able to depend on the regular wakeup from mm when the vcpu is blocked.
The extra information from page-present lets the guest know it can now touch these pages
without getting blocked ... they shouldn't need a wakeup.

This hash stuff doesn't look at all specific to arm64. Could it be moved to core code or a
shared header file so multiple architectures only need one copy of the code.
If they need to be different, it would be good to know why.
