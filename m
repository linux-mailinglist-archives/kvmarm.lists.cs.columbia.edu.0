Hi Alex,

I like 'target'.

Sounds like a good idea. unittests.cfg could get a new option 'targets'
where a list of targets is given. If targets is not present, then the
test assumes it's for all targets. Might be nice to also accept !<target>
syntax. E.g.

# builds/runs for all targets
[mytest]
file = mytest.flat

# builds/runs for given targets
[mytest2]
file = mytest2.flat
targets = qemu,kvmtool

# builds/runs for all targets except disabled targets
[mytest3]
file = mytest3.flat
targets = !kvmtool

And it wouldn't bother me to have special logic for kvmtool's lack of
migration put directly in scripts/runtime.bash

diff --git a/scripts/runtime.bash b/scripts/runtime.bash

While we'd risk automated configure+build tools, like git{hub,lab} CI,
failing, I think the risk is pretty low right now that anybody is using
the option. Also, we might as well make them change sooner than later by
failing configure. IOW, I'd just do s/vmm/target/g to rename it now. If
we are concerned about the disruption, then I'd just make vmm an alias
for target and not bother deprecating it ever.

Thanks,
drew
