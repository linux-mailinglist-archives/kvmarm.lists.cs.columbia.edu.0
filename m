This trust model is hard for me to reason about. userspace is trusted to
control the life cycle of the VM, to prepare the memslots for the VM,
and [presumably] identify what MMIO ranges are valid, yet it's not
trusted to handle invalid MMIO accesses. I'd like to learn more about
this model and the userspace involved.

The fun never stops.
