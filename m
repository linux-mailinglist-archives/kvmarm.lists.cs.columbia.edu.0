Supposing we don't preallocate some hypercall ID registers, how can we
safely migrate a guest from an older kernel to newer kernel? Ideally,
we would preserve the hypercall feature set across the migration which
could work for a while with the first set of registers that get
defined, but whenever a new hypercall firmware register comes along
then the VMM will be clueless to the new ABI.

Fundamentally, I don't think userspace should need a patch to preserve
ABI on a newer kernel. Despite that, it would seem that userspace will
need to learn of any firmware registers that control hypercall
features which come after the initial set that gets proposed. If
KVM_GET_REG_LIST were to disambiguate between ID registers (hypercall,
architectural feature ID registers) from other parts of the vCPU
state, it would be clear to what registers to zero on a newer kernel.
Apologies if it is distracting to mention the feature ID registers
here, but both are on my mind currently and want to make sure there is
some consistency in how features get handled on newer kernels,
architected or not.

Oliver
