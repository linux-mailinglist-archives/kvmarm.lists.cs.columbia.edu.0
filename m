Had another go at this, and as I was looking at the code, I realized that
conceptually, trapping debug registers access (MDCR_EL2.TDA) is tied to:

- KVM_ARM64_DEBUG_DIRTY *not* being set (guest is debugging itself and KVM will
world-switch the debug registers).

- KVM_GUESTDBG_USE_HW being set, which also *sets* KVM_ARM64_DEBUG_DIRTY (host is
debugging the guest using hardware breakpoints).

So I cannot set the MDCR_EL2.TDA bit based on KVM_ARM64_DEBUG_DIRTY, because I
would lose one of the two cases. It looks to me that keeping
kvm_arm_setup_mdcr_el2() unchanged and calling it at the start of
kvm_arm_setup_debug() is the way to go here.

Thanks,

Alex
