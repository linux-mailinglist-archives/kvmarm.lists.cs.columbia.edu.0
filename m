The encoding is very neat by the way :D

I see where you're going with the lent state now, and I understand the
states as well as the possible transitions now that you've explained
it.

It's the terminology that confused me a bit (especially when you
mention lending, which seemed to imply is something distinct from
borrowing as opposed to just the other side of it). What for me would
help is to document this, and the possible combinations/legal states.
kvm_pgtable.h describes the prots a bit, but maybe you could expand
that similar to what you've done in this email:

@KVM_PGTABLE_STATE_BORROWED: Page borrowed from another entity: has
access to the page but no ownership

Not sure if defining aliases for all legal combinations would also
help or add to the confusion, thinking out loud, something along the
lines of cache state taxonomy (e.g., Sweazy and Smith fig 3 [1]). You
have that in the borrowed (as opposed to owned), and shared (as
opposed to exclusive). So aliases to build on these:

#define KVM_PGTABLE_STATE_BORROWED_SHARED (KVM_PGTABLE_STATE_SHARED |
KVM_PGTABLE_STATE_BORROWED)
#define KVM_PGTABLE_STATE_BORROWED_EXCLUSIVE (KVM_PGTABLE_STATE_BORROWED)
#define KVM_PGTABLE_STATE_OWNED_SHARED (KVM_PGTABLE_STATE_SHARED)
#define KVM_PGTABLE_STATE_OWNED_EXCLUSIVE (0ULL)

You have thought about this way more than I have. But I think that
having clear documentation, ideally in the code itself via
helpers/enums/aliases could help people like me who come to the code
later not shoot themselves in the foot.

Thanks!
