It is a bit involved at the moment, and I haven't tried on a laptop
(the nice thing about the Mini is that you can bury it under a pile of
other machines and still make use of it).

The Asahi wiki has a bunch of RE goodies, but you really don't need to
know much about the HW to follow what this series does. Actually, you
instead need to understand what the GIC guarantees to the guest,
because this is all about the GIC emulation on a non-GIC interrupt
controller.

Thanks,
