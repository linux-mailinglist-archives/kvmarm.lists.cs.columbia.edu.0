When I had said 'one giant pseudoregister' I actually meant 'one
pseudoregister per event', not all of SDEI into a single
structure. Since most of this is in flux now, it is hard to point
out what/how we should migrate from conversation alone.

And on the topic of Raghavendra's series, I do not believe it is
required anymore here w/ the removal of shared events, which I'm
strongly in favor of.

Let's delve deeper into migration on the next series :)

I don't think we have sufficient encoding space in the register ID
to allow for arbitrary length registers. Any new registers for SDEI will
need to fit into one of the predefined sizes. Note that we've already
conditioned userspace to handle registers this way and anything else is
an ABI change.
