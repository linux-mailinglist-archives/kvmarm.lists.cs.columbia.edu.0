Fair enough.

This can at least happen in arch_timer_stop() [arm_arch_timer.c], where
the disable_percpu_irq() API will disable the interrupt (via irq_mask()
callback which will in turn disable the interrupt at GIC level by
programming the ICENABLER0).

What I'm worried is something like:

1. Disable the timer interrupt (at RDist level by poking the ICENABLER0,
    or at CPU level by masking PSTATE.I)

   [ timer interrupt is made pending, and remains pending in (v)GIC. ]

2. Disable the timer
3. Enable the timer interrupt (at RDist level by poking the ISENABLER0,
    or at CPU level by unmasking PSTATE.I)

   [ The interrupt is forwarded to (v)CPU, and we end-up re-enabling the
     timer inside the timer IRQ handler, which may not be as expected. ]

I'm just not sure if this will be a possible scenario in the Linux, and
is it harmful if this would happen.

This actually doesn't match the spec. Arm ARM D13.8.25 has a description
about the ISTATUS field as below,

"When the value of the ENABLE bit is 0, the ISTATUS field is UNKNOWN."

I guess what Nianyao had posted [*] may address the concern above...
