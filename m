Ok.

Well, sort of. I don't expect large mount of dirty pages will be tracked by
the backup bitmap :)

Thanks for the details to explain. Right, It's true for WARN to catch KVM bugs
instead of user-triggerable bugs. I agree that none of WARN/printk/ratelimited_printk()
is applicable in this case.

Ok. I've posted formal patch for 'next' branch, with the improved commit message.
Please take a look when you get a chance.
