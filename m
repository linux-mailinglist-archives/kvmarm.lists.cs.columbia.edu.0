The question is what do you if you have something pending in DISR_EL1
at the point where you enter EL2? Context switching it is not going to
help. One problem is that you'd need to do an ESB, corrupting DISR_EL1,
before any memory access (I'm assuming you can get traps where all
registers are live). I can't see how we square this circle.

Furthermore, assuming you find a way to do it, what do you do with it?

(a) Either there was something pending already and it is still pending,

(b) Or there was nothing pending and you now have an error that you
     don't know how to report (the host EL1 never issued an ESB)

We could just error out on hypercalls if DISR_EL1 is non-zero, but
I don't see how we do that for traps, as it would just confuse the host
EL1.
