Good point, the VMID is needed in that situation.

__load_stage2() _only_ has the ISB if ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_AT is
present, whereas I think you need one unconditionall here so that the
system register write has taken effect before the TLB invalidation.

It's similar to the comment at the end of __tlb_switch_to_guest().

Having said that, I do worry that ARM64_WORKAROUND_SPECULATIVE_AT probably
needs a closer look in the world of pKVM, since it currently special-cases
the host.

Cool, then you can do that for both the TLBI and the DSB instructions (and
please add a comment that the invalidation is due to the HCR bits).

Agreed, maybe it's worth checking the return value.

I can see it both ways, but updating the kerneldoc for
kvm_pgtable_stage2_idmap_greedy() to state in which cases the range is
updated and how would be helpful. It just says "negative error code on
failure" at the moment.
