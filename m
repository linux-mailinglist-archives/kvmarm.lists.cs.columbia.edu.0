I think the patch is valid and the alternatives would be unnecessarily
complicated. During a normal scan for free pages to isolate, there
is a check for pageblock_pfn_to_page() which uses a pfn_valid check
for non-contiguous zones in __pageblock_pfn_to_page. Now, while the
non-contiguous check could be made in the area you highlight, it would be a
relatively small optimisation that would be unmeasurable overall. However,
it is definitely the case that if the PFN you highlight is invalid that
badness happens. If you want to express this as a signed-off patch with
an adjusted changelog then I'd be happy to add

Reviewed-by: Mel Gorman <mgorman@techsingularity.net>

If you are not comfortable with rewriting the changelog and formatting
it as a patch then I can do it on your behalf and preserve your
Signed-off-by. Just let me know.

Thanks for researching this, I think it also applies to other people but
had not found the time to track it down.
