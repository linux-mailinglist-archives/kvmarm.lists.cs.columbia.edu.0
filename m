I did try the other way as well and found it was creating it's
own problems - you end up with two almost identical enums which
need to be separately named in some meaningful yet not
excessively verbose fashion and have to remember which one to use
in which context.

I'm confident I understand well enough what it's doing, I'm just
really unclear on why it's written the way it is.

Indeed, I'm not a big fan myself.  I also don't want to get this
and some other work I'm doing tied up on stylistic improvements
to what's already there which seem likely introduce additional
iterations - I'd rather loop back on this as a separate thing
later.
