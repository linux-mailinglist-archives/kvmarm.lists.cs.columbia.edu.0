Yep, it was very easy to figure out what needs to be done to get the tests
running again.

Well, kvm-unit-tests selects KVM or TCG under the hood without the user
being involved at all. In my opinion, it's slightly better from an
usability perspective for kvm-unit-tests to do its best to run the tests
based on what the user specifically set (QEMU=qemu-system-arm) than fail to
run the tests because of an internal heuristic of which the user might be
entirely ignorant (if arm64 and /dev/kvm is available, pick ACCEL=kvm).

Regardless, I don't have a strong opinion either way, and it's trivial for
a user to figure out that ACCEL=tcg will make the tests run. So from my
side this is mostly academic and the test runner can stay as it is if you
don't see a reason to change it.

Thanks,
Alex
